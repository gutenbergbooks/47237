<p>The era of the American Revolution is so fraught with romance
that it ever will prove a chosen one to novelists. In this present instance
the author has selected unusually stirring historic incidents,
around whose facts he has woven a most beautiful and enticing story
of love, devotion and patriotism. Such tales fire the love of our
country in the hearts of all, old and young; while they fill, in the
highest degree, the love for romance, which <i>all persons</i> possess. The
"Maid of Esopus" is a <i>purely historical</i> fiction, written with a thorough
knowledge of the men and women of those times which truly tried
and tempered souls, and embodies all the interest which attaches to
that most eventful era. It will be found not only unexceptionable as
a novel, but <i>unusually</i> good in its literary merits, as well as intensely
exciting and absorbing in its narrative. It will become a household
favorite.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BRIDLE-PATH.</p>


<p>A small valley cutting through a range of mountains in
California&mdash;a green oasis that looked strange and picturesque
in the midst of that savage scenery. The cliffs rose in a solid
wall on one side to the height of many hundred feet.
Dwarfed fir-trees and dead cedars were scattered along the
summit, stretching up their gaunt limbs and adding to the
lonely grandeur of the scene. Great masses of broken rocks,
which, in some conflict of the elements, had been wrenched
from their bed, projected from the rifted precipices and lay in
great moss-covered boulders in the lap of the valley. On the
southeastern side a break in the heart of the cliffs was covered
with thrifty verdure, and, over the rocks that obstructed
it, a mountain torrent rushed thundering into the valley,
dividing that cradle of verdure in the middle, and abruptly
disappearing through another gorge, breaking to the open
country somewhat lower down, where it plunged over a
second precipice with the sound of distant artillery.</p>

<p>Just above the spot where this mountain stream cut the
valley in twain, a collection of huts, tents and rickety frame
houses composed one of those new villages that are so often
found in a frontier country, and half a mile above stood a
small ranche, with its long, low-roofed dwelling half buried
in heavy vines that clambered up the rude cedar pillars of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
veranda, and crept in leafy masses along the roof. Beyond
this, great oaks sheltered the dwelling, and the precipice that
loomed behind it was broken with rifts of verdure, which
saved this portion of the valley from the savage aspect of the
mountains lower down.</p>

<p>The sunset was streaming over this picturesque spot; great
masses of gorgeous clouds, piled up in the west, were casting
their glory down the valley, turning the waters to gold, and,
flashing against the metallic sides of the mountains, changed
them into rifts and ledges of solid gems.</p>

<p>Standing upon the rustic veranda, and looking down over
the beautiful valley dotted with tents and picturesque cabins,
the waters singing pleasantly, the evening wind fluttering the
greenness of the trees, that mountain pass appeared so tranquil
and quiet, a stranger could hardly have believed the
repose only an occasional thing. In truth, it is the heavenly
aspect of the valley that I have given you, and that was
truly beautiful.</p>

<p>Only a few miles off, still higher up among the rugged
mountains, the "gold diggings" commenced, and from this
point, every Saturday night of that beautiful summer, came
down crowds of wild, reckless men with their bowie-knives,
revolvers, and the gold-dust which soon changed hands either
at the liquor-bar, set up in some log-cabin, or the gambling-table,
established in an opposite shanty.</p>

<p>Before the gold excitement, that pretty ranche had been the
abode of a quiet family, whose cattle were fed on the luxuriant
herbage of the valley; but the reckless adventurers that
crowded there soon drove the household into less turbulent
quarters, and the dwelling changed its occupants many times.
Thus its quiet walls soon became accustomed to scenes of
strife and dissipation, which destroyed its respectable, home-like
appearance entirely; and the place that had originally
been a pleasing feature in the valley shared the general
aspect of the neighborhood. Still, nature will assert her
rights; and, amid the wild riot of the valley, vines grew luxuriantly
as ever, flowers blossomed in the turf, and the water
fall sounded loud and clear above the shouts of savage men,
however turbulently they might be raised.</p>

<p>By one of the upper windows of this dwelling stood a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
woman, leaning idly against the rude sill and looking down
the sweep of the valley.</p>

<p>Hers was no attitude of expectation; there was no eagerness
in the great eyes that wandered slowly from one object
to another, nor did the glance betray any enjoyment of the
beautiful scene. The woman was evidently lost in deep and
melancholy thought; each moment the lines about her mouth
deepened, and the cold sadness of the eyes settled into a hard,
bitter expression which gave something almost repulsive to
the whole face.</p>

<p>She looked very unlike the sort of woman one would have
expected to find in that solitary place. She was tall and
slender, and her form would have appeared almost fragile had
it not been for a certain flexibility and force visible in every
line even in that attitude of repose.</p>

<p>She was young still; but from her face it would have been
impossible to guess at her real age. At one moment it looked
fairly girlish; the next the shadow of some heavy thought
swept across it and appeared to accomplish the work of years
upon the features.</p>

<p>It was evident that her fate had been very different from
that which met most of the women who followed husbands
and fortune into the Eldorado of the New World. The hand
which lay upon the window-frame was delicate and white;
the colorless pallor of the cheek bore no evidence of hardship
or exposure.</p>

<p>She was plainly dressed, but her garments were made in a
picturesque fashion, and the few ornaments she wore were
heavy and rich. Her long, golden hair was brushed smoothly
back from her forehead and gathered in shining bands at the
back of her head, and made the chief beauty of her person.
Only those who have seen the tress of Lucretia Borgia's hair,
preserved still in a foreign gallery, can form any idea of the
peculiar color which I desire to describe. I was wrong to
call it golden; it was too pale for that. In the shadow it had
the colorless tint one seldom sees, except in the locks of very
young children; but when she moved, so that the sun struck
its loose ripples, it flashed out so brightly that it crowned her
forehead like a halo.</p>

<p>The sunset deepened, but still the lady remained leaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
out of the window and giving herself up to that gloomy
meditation, which sometimes seemed to deepen into absolute
pain.</p>

<p>Suddenly a new object at the upper end of the valley
attracted her attention, and she gazed with more eagerness
than she had before manifested.</p>

<p>Leading by the place where the mountain torrent had cleft
its way through the rocks, there ran a bridle-path, worn by
the miners' feet, from the gold diggings down the valley. It
was toward that spot the lady's eyes were directed, as a small
cavalcade wound slowly down the rocky path and took the
grassy plain which led toward the ranche.</p>

<p>An expression of displeasure disturbed the stillness of the
woman's face. She shaded her eyes with her hand and
looked eagerly toward the advancing group; but at that distance
it was impossible to distinguish more than that it consisted
of three men mounted on mules, followed by several
persons on foot.</p>

<p>She moved quickly from the window and passed into
another room; in a moment she returned, carrying a spyglass
which she directed toward the procession. After the
first glance she drew a heavy breath and muttered:</p>

<p>"It is not they! I shall have an hour more to myself, at
all events."</p>

<p>She still continued to watch the slowly approaching group,
and saw that one of the equestrians was supported in his saddle
by two of the guides, while another led the mule by the
bridle. The rider had evidently met with some accident on
the road.</p>

<p>Slowly the party moved on; they were in recognizable
distance from the house; by the aid of her glass, the lady
could distinguish the lineaments of each face.</p>

<p>Suddenly she grasped the glass hard in both hands and
looked steadily at the injured man. A great change passed
over her; she trembled violently and her face grew ashen.
Her fingers shook so that she was obliged to support the glass
against the window-sill. At length her hands fell to her side
and a cry broke from her lips like the angry moan of some
wounded animal.</p>

<p>"Oh! I must be mad!" she exclaimed. "This can not
be&mdash;I fancied it! This is one of my wild dreams!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>With a powerful effort she controlled herself sufficiently to
raise the glass once more. Nearer and nearer the group
advanced; her eyes were fastened upon it with a look of
unutterable fear and agony.</p>

<p>"Laurence!" she exclaimed again; "Laurence in this
place! Oh! I shall go mad! They are coming to the house&mdash;they
mean to spend the night here!" The words broke
unconsciously from her lips; all the while her strained gaze
was fastened upon the group. "He has been hurt&mdash;he has
fainted!"</p>

<p>She dropped the glass and started to her full height, striking
her forehead violently with her clenched hand, as if
searching for some plan or device, which, in her agitation and
terror, she could not find.</p>

<p>"Fool!" she muttered, bitterly. "Is this your strength?
Does it desert you now?"</p>

<p>She walked hurriedly up and down the room, flinging her
arms about, so overcome that any thing like connected thought
was impossible.</p>

<p>"He must not see me&mdash;I would rather be hurled over the
precipice! He must not stay here. Oh! mercy&mdash;mercy! if
Philip should come home!"</p>

<p>She cast one more feverish glance through the window and
hurried out of the room, nerved to action by the near approach
of pain and danger. But directly she came back again, looking
wild and frightened, like a bird coming back to the branch
where it has been wounded. She took up the glass again,
steadied it firmly. She was evidently doubtful still if she had
seen aright.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A FACE FROM THE PAST.</p>


<p>The party of strangers were slowly winding their way
across the plain, and had arrived within a short distance of
the house. The woman gazed on them through her glass till
the man supported on his mule became quite visible to the
naked eye; she then dropped her hand heavily, and drew a
deep breath.</p>

<p>"How white he is! There has been violence. He has
fainted. See how his head falls on the guide's shoulder," she
murmured, sweeping a hand across her eyes as if some dimness
had come over them.</p>

<p>The lady was quite alone in her dwelling. The Indian
women who acted as the household servants had gone to the
hills in search of berries, and thus she was compelled to
descend and open the door, when a summons was made by
the party whose approach had given her so much anxiety.
At another time, knowing, as she did, the lawless nature of
the population around, she would have allowed the besiegers
to knock unanswered, and go away at their leisure; but now
she descended the stairs, trembling violently as she went.
She had thrown a black silk scarf over her head, thus giving
her dress a Spanish effect, and, unclosing the door, stood framed
in the opening&mdash;and a more remarkable picture was never
presented in the wilderness of any country. It was not that
the woman was so beautiful, in fact, but the color of her hair
and the wild anxiety in her eyes gave that to her person
which no artist could ever have caught. The guide, who had
come in advance of his party, stepped back in amazement as
she presented herself, for it was seldom that the people of the
region had obtained a glimpse of her person, and her presence
took him by surprise.</p>

<p>The party were now within a few minutes' ride of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
ranche, and a weary, travel-soiled band it was. The mules
were stained far above their fetlocks with yellow mud, through
which they had floundered all day long; and the travelers, in
their slouched hats, rude, blue flannel shirts, and heavy boots,
engulfing the nether garments to the knees, were liberally
bespattered with the same compound. The mules were
huddled close together, for one of the riders was supporting
the wounded man on his saddle; the other had dismounted
when the guide left him, and was leading the sick man's mule,
while his own tired beast followed submissively in the wake
of the party.</p>

<p>Before the guide had recovered from his astonishment
sufficiently to address the lady, who seemed perfectly unconscious
of his presence, the party halted in front of the veranda.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen sprung forward to assist their companion,
who lay helpless in his saddle, his head falling upon
the shoulder of the man that supported him. With the
assistance of the guides he was removed from the mule and
carried up the steps of the veranda. They laid him upon a
bench under the windows, then the two companions of the
insensible man turned toward the lady.</p>

<p>She had not stirred; her eyes were fastened upon the
motionless figure over which the guides were bending with
rough solicitude; the strained, eager look in her face seemed
to demand an explanation which her lips had no power to
frame.</p>

<p>The two gentlemen moved toward her, struck, even in that
moment of anxiety, by her appearance, and saluted her with
the courtesy which proved their station and high-breeding.</p>

<p>"We owe you a thousand apologies, madam," said the
foremost, "for this abrupt proceeding; but our friend here had
a hurt."</p>

<p>She started at his words, instinctively drew the folds of the
mantle more closely about her face, and said, quickly:</p>

<p>"No apology is necessary; in this region strangers consider
themselves at home in every house."</p>

<p>"I thought you'd say so, ma'am," said one of the guides,
approaching and looking curiously at her. "I s'pose Mr.
Yates ain't to hum."</p>

<p>"No; I believe he is at the mines," she answered; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
added quickly, pointing to the injured man: "Has he
fainted?"</p>

<p>"You see he got a fall," answered the guide, before either
of the gentlemen could speak, "a-coming over that rough pass
on the mountain; but I think he's only stunted like."</p>

<p>"I am afraid his arm is broken," said the elder gentleman.</p>

<p>The lady hurried toward the injured man; her face was
turned away, so that none of the party could see how ghastly
it became. She bent over the still form, dextrously cut open
the sleeve of his coat with a pair of scissors which she drew
from her pocket, and took the injured limb between her
trembling hands.</p>

<p>"It is only a sprain," she said; "the agony and the shock
have been too much for him."</p>

<p>"He bore it very well at first," said the gentleman who
had followed her; "but fainted quite suddenly, just as we got
down into the valley."</p>

<p>The lady made him no answer; she directed the guides
where to find water and spirits. Going into the house herself,
she brought out a large napkin, which she saturated with
water, and bound upon the wounded arm.</p>

<p>While she was bending over him, the man gave signs of
returning consciousness. She started back, and shrouded her
face completely in the mantle.</p>

<p>"Laurence," called one of his friends, stooping over him,
"are you better?"</p>

<p>There was a faint murmur; the injured man raised his
head, but it sunk back, and he was insensible again.</p>

<p>"Is there no physician near?" demanded the gentleman.
"I am very anxious. He is not strong, like the rest of us."</p>

<p>"You will find one at Wilson's ranche," replied the lady.</p>

<p>"How far is that?"</p>

<p>"Good seven miles," answered the guide.</p>

<p>"It will take so long to get him here," exclaimed the first
speaker.</p>

<p>"Your best way will be to go there," observed the lady,
coldly.</p>

<p>The whole party turned toward her in astonishment; hospitality
is the chief virtue of wild countries, and it was an
unparalleled thing in the experience of those old guides, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
hear a woman so coolly turning a stranger, sick or injured,
from her door.</p>

<p>"My dear madam," pleaded the gentleman, "he can not
ride; it will be dangerous&mdash;death, perhaps."</p>

<p>"He will come to himself, shortly," she answered. "I
assure you I have proposed the best mode. I do not mean it
unkindly. Heaven knows how sorry I am."</p>

<p>The eldest guide absolutely whistled, and the men stared
at each other, while she busied herself over Laurence, although
her whole frame shook so violently that she could scarcely
stand.</p>

<p>"Can't you give us a bed for our friend?" asked the gentleman.
"The rest of us will sleep anywhere, or go away
altogether."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no," she replied, hastily; "you must ride on, I say."</p>

<p>"Wal, I'm shot if ever I heerd the beat of that!" muttered
a guide.</p>

<p>"The road from here is very good," she continued; "your
friend will suffer little; these men can easily make a litter
and carry him."</p>

<p>"He's coming to," whispered the other gentleman.</p>

<p>The woman stepped quickly back, and when she saw the
injured man open his eyes, retreated into the room.</p>

<p>"How are you now, Laurence?" asked his friends, bending
over him.</p>

<p>"Better, I think; I am dizzy, but my arm isn't so very
painful. Did I faint?"</p>

<p>While they answered his questions, the guides held a
grumbling consultation, and finally summoned the elder
gentleman to the conference.</p>

<p>"What'll we do?" they asked. "It'll be pitch dark afore
long, and that fellar can't set his horse."</p>

<p>"I will speak to the lady again," he answered. "I am
sure she can not turn us out."</p>

<p>"It's a queer house," said the head guide, "and that's the
fact. There ain't a place in Californy I wouldn't ruther stop
at."</p>

<p>"I s'pose that's Yates's wife," said the man who had first
reached the house. "As often as I've passed here, I never
seed her afore."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tisn't often she shows herself," replied the leader. "But
will you go and speak to her?" he added, turning to the
gentleman.</p>

<p>"Certainly; of course she will permit us to stay."</p>

<p>He went into the house, but the lady was not visible. He
opened the door of an inner room, and there she stood, wringing
her hands in wild distress. She turned at the sound of
his footstep, and demanded, angrily:</p>

<p>"What do you wish more? I have done all that I can for
your friend."</p>

<p>"I have come to urge you to give us one night's lodging,"
he said; "it seems impossible for us to go on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must," she said, interrupting him passionately; "you
must!"</p>

<p>"This is very singular," he said, so startled by her manner
that he was almost inclined to believe her insane. "In the
name of humanity, I ask&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped him with an impatient gesture, went close to
him, and grasped his arm.</p>

<p>"I tell you," she whispered, "this place is not safe for you;
get on toward Wilson's as fast as your mules can carry you."</p>

<p>"Surely you can not mean&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No matter what! Sir, I ask you, for my sake, a poor,
defenseless woman, to go! I have done all for your friend
that is in my power; you only endanger his life&mdash;mine too,
by staying here."</p>

<p>He bowed, stupefied by her words.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he said; "after that I can not urge you."</p>

<p>"I knew you would not; only go&mdash;don't wait an instant!"</p>

<p>She spoke with feverish haste, and her whole appearance
was that of a person driven to the verge of distraction by fear
and anxiety.</p>

<p>"I can give you food," she added, "or spirits&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you; we have every thing with us that will be
necessary."</p>

<p>"Then go! Your road leads by the river&mdash;keep that napkin
about his arm wet with water, and he will do very well."</p>

<p>She motioned him away with wild energy. He saw the
insane dread in her eyes, left the room without a word, and
joined the party upon the veranda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do we stay?" demanded the guides.</p>

<p>The gentleman shook his head, and, without waiting to
hear their angry expostulations, moved toward his friend.</p>

<p>Laurence was sitting up, and, although still very pale,
looked stronger and greatly recovered.</p>

<p>"Could you ride a few miles further, Ned?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Possibly; but can't we stay here?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no; there's a deuced mystery about the whole matter!
But we must start, or I believe that woman will go
crazy; don't let's wait a moment, if you can manage to get
on to your mule."</p>

<p>The lady's strange anxiety had infected him; he felt an
unaccountable eagerness to leave that quiet old house far
behind, and would rather have spent the whole night in the
woods than again encounter the frenzied pleading of her eyes.</p>

<p>In a few moments, their preparations were concluded.
Laurence was seated upon his mule in the most commodious
manner that could be devised, and the party rode slowly off
down the valley, the guides looking back with muttered
execrations as long as the old house was in sight.</p>

<p>From an upper window the woman watched them start,
shivering and white, with her hands pressed hard against her
lips to keep back the moans that shuddered from her heart.</p>

<p>As the cavalcade reached a turn in the road, and began to
disappear from her sight, she extended her arms with a low
cry:</p>

<p>"Laurence! Laurence!"</p>

<p>The words were pronounced in a whisper, but to her
affrighted senses they sounded strangely clear. She cowered
into a seat, and covered her face with her hands. No tears
fell from her eyes; she could not even weep&mdash;could only sit
there, trembling at every sound, looking eagerly out to be
certain that the travelers had indeed disappeared, then glancing
up the valley, as if expecting each moment to see some
one approach by the path which led from the mountains.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HUSBAND AND WIFE.</p>


<p>Night had come on; the full moon was up, filling the
valley with a flood of radiance and lending a mysterious
beauty to the scene. As the silver beams shot against the
mountain sides, the streaks of quartz and glittering minerals
emitted long rays of light that shone so brilliantly the cliffs
seemed encircled with flame. Above rose the jagged trunks
of the fir-trees, looking like wierd shapes holding counsel upon
the summit of the peaks.</p>

<p>At length sounds from without broke the stillness&mdash;the
tramp of horses, the loud, reckless conversation of coarse men.
The watcher in that room only cowered lower into her seat,
as if those tones had deprived her of the last gleam of strength
which had been her support during the previous hours.</p>

<p>There were voices from the room beneath&mdash;drinking songs
chanted with such energy that the words were distinctly
audible where she sat&mdash;the ring of glasses, rude toasts and
the tumult in which heedless, hardened men are wont to
indulge in the midst of a bacchanalian revel.</p>

<p>Very soon there was a step upon the stairs, which made
the woman spring to her feet and throw aside the mantle in
which she had been shrouding her face. The door was
pushed open and a man entered carrying a candle, which
flared uncertainly in the draught from the passage. He did
not at first perceive her, and called angrily:</p>

<p>"Sybil! Sybil! where the deuce are you, I say?"</p>

<p>"I am here," she replied, with a coldness and composure
of which she had appeared incapable a moment before.
"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"What is a man likely to want when he comes home tired
and hungry, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"The women are getting supper; it will be ready very
soon."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"And what are you doing up here in the dark?"</p>

<p>"This is the room where I usually sit, and it certainly is
not dark," she replied, quietly as before, although her hands
trembled nervously, and the expression of her eyes betrayed
something akin to absolute fear.</p>

<p>"Sitting in the moonlight like a school-girl!" he sneered.
"I should think you might have got over your romance by
this time."</p>

<p>She did not answer; he approached, and held the light
close to her face, with a sneering laugh.</p>

<p>"Who has been here to-day?" he asked. "Now, don't
tell that lie you have ready on your lips. I know there was
a party of men here about sunset."</p>

<p>"Some people who wished to stay all night," she replied.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you keep them?"</p>

<p>"I did not suppose you would like it, as I knew you would
be back with a party from the mines."</p>

<p>"How innocent she is!" he exclaimed, laughing again.
"By the powers, Sybil, I have made a mistake! I ought to
have put you on the stage. That sort of talent would have
made a fortune for us both."</p>

<p>"It is not too late," she said, with a certain eagerness.</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it? Well, we can talk about that some other
time. Just now I want to know what brought that Laurence
here?"</p>

<p>She tried to look at him with astonishment, but, actress as
she was, her craft failed for once; the lids drooped over her
eyes and her lips refused to utter the words she struggled to
force upon them.</p>

<p>"Now stop that," said he. "Just tell the truth, or I'll
follow him, and he shall have a taste of my bowie-knife before
morning. What did he want? Make a short story of it, for
I am hungry."</p>

<p>"He had been traveling among the mountains with some
friends, and got hurt. They wanted to stay here, but I would
not keep them and they went away."</p>

<p>"So far so good! You was afraid I should kill him, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she answered; "but more afraid that he would
recognize me."</p>

<p>"Then you didn't speak to him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; he had fainted. I was not likely to make myself
known to any of my former friends," she added, bitterly.</p>

<p>"As Phil Yates the gambler's wife? No, I suppose not.
Well, he is gone, so let the matter rest. Come, you're a
rather good girl. I want you to dress yourself and come
down to supper&mdash;look your prettiest."</p>

<p>"Who is there?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mostly our set of fellows."</p>

<p>"Then I shall not go down."</p>

<p>"Indeed! I haven't time to make a scene. There are a
couple of young chaps fresh from the mines with lots of gold-dust.
Now will you come?"</p>

<p>"Will you promise to conduct yourselves like men?"</p>

<p>"Upon my word, she is making terms! Yes, I will. I
tell you, Sybil, the gold we win from them to-night will help
to shorten your stay here. Think of that, and come."</p>

<p>"I don't wish any supper. I will come down afterward."</p>

<p>"So be it. Put on the pink dress with all those flounces,
that I brought you from San Francisco, and look young, and
do try and be handsome again."</p>

<p>"Shall we be able to go from here soon, Philip?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Not a day before I please," he replied, irritated by the
question. "Show any anxiety, and you shall spend your life
here. I promise you it shall not be a pleasant one."</p>

<p>"Have I complained?" she demanded, sinking her voice to
a tone of singular sweetness. "Have I not clung to you as
few women would have done? Can you blame me for
longing to have another home than this?"</p>

<p>"It is natural enough; but patience, Sybil, patience."</p>

<p>"I have had patience," she muttered, while a dangerous
light shot into her eyes, "so long&mdash;so long!"</p>

<p>"You are a great woman, Sybil, I always admit that; but
you know very well that if you left me I should have hunted
you like a wolf&mdash;aha! my bird!"</p>

<p>The gleam in her eyes died into a look of cold terror; she
extended her hand for the light, saying:</p>

<p>"Go down to your guests. I will follow very soon."</p>

<p>He gave her the candle, laughing again in that mocking
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Poor Sybil!" he said. "It is hard to have old memories
stirred up as they have come upon you this evening."</p>

<p>"Stop!" she said, with a quiet resolution. "You shall not
worry my life out, Philip Yates! You know there is a point
beyond which I will not bear a word or look. Reach it, and
though you murdered me, I would desert you!"</p>

<p>He gave her a glance of careless admiration, but did not
annoy her further.</p>

<p>Yates was a remarkable-looking man as he stood there in
his rough mountain dress, which was sufficiently picturesque
in effect to atone for the coarseness of its materials and make.</p>

<p>He could not have been over thirty-five&mdash;very possibly not
so much; but a life of reckless dissipation had long ago worn
the youth out from his face. He had once been handsome&mdash;was
so still, in spite of his heavy, undressed beard and the desperate
expression of his features. He was tall and remarkably
well formed, with sinewy limbs and a full, broad chest. The
exposure and action which he had experienced in that wild
California existence had increased his manly beauty in strength
and proportion, to make amends for sweeping the delicacy
and refinement from his face. The eyes were gray, not
prominent, usually half vailed by the lids, with a cold, quiet
expression which could warm into eagerness or flame with
passion, but were utterly incapable of any thing like softness
or sensibility. The lower part of the face was hidden by the
flowing beard of a rich chestnut brown; but the massive contour
of the under jaw, the firm-set mouth, betrayed enough to
have justified a physiognomist in ascribing to him the hard,
reckless character which in reality belonged to him.</p>

<p>Without again addressing his wife, he left the room. She
heard him whistling an opera air&mdash;some reminiscence of the
old life&mdash;as he descended the stairs, and the notes carried her
back to the pleasant existence which had been hers for a
season, and from which that man had so ruthlessly dragged her.</p>

<p>The light which kindled in her eyes was ominous; the
expression of her face, could he have seen it, might have
awakened a deeper distrust in his mind than had ever before
troubled him. It would have justified a fear for his personal
safety. There was all that and more in the single glance
which she cast into the gloom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>No murmur escaped her; she did not even sigh, as a
weaker or gentler woman would have done; but, knowing
her destiny, looked it full in the face and went forward to
meet it without a tear!</p>

<p>She took up the candle and passed into her chamber, proceeding
to change her dress and follow her husband's
commands in the adornment of her person.</p>

<p>She knew very well what was required of her&mdash;a part that
she had often before performed at his bidding, and one from
which her moral sensibilities did not always shrink. This
woman had simply to make herself pleasant and agreeable&mdash;to
sit by and converse sweetly while those two strangers were
cheated of their hard-earned gold at a card-table. She was
to bewilder them by her smiles and conversation&mdash;nothing
more; and, as I have said, she did not always shrink from
this <i>rôle</i>.</p>

<p>Sybil Yates was not a good woman, and yet there was
something in her nature which, under other training and
circumstances, might have dignified her into a very different
person. Her phrenological developments would have puzzled
the most devoted lover of that unsatisfactory science. She
was capable of great endurance and self-sacrifice, not only to
secure her own interests, but she was earnest in the service of
any one for whom she felt affection or attachment. Her nature
was essentially reticent and secretive; she had a faculty which
few women possess, that of waiting patiently and for a long
time, in order to attain any object which fastened itself on her
desire.</p>

<p>But it is useless attempting any description of the woman's
character. It will best develop itself in the course of this
narrative, in which it was her fate to act a prominent part.</p>

<p>That she must have loathed the life to which she found
herself condemned is certain. Sybil's heart was more depraved
than her intellect or her moral character, and any thing like
coarseness or open vice was essentially distasteful to her. It
was this womanly refinement which had made the presence
of her husband a torment. Probably hatred of this man
had grown to be one of the strongest feelings in her nature;
yet she was kind and forbearing&mdash;every thing that even
a good and affectionate wife could have been in her domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
life. True, she stood in mortal terror of him&mdash;base, physical
terror, for he had become degraded beyond belief, and had
more than once raised his hand against her in his drunken
wrath.</p>

<p>Still she clung to him&mdash;put her old life resolutely aside,
and looked only forward to the time when he would take her
from that dreary wilderness and go out into the world where
she had first keenly enjoyed the sweets of refined life.</p>

<p>She had fine talents, a splendid education, and was well
endowed for any station in which destiny could have placed
her. Let me do her the justice to acknowledge that under
better influences she would probably have been simply a far-sighted,
diplomatic woman of the world, reducing all about
her to obedience by the incomprehensible fascination which
made all men who approached her admirers or slaves. Satisfied
with her position and influence, the under depths of her
nature would have been so little excited, that in all probability
she herself would have been forever unconscious of the dark
traits which lay hidden in her restless heart.</p>

<p>But it was useless to speculate upon what she might have
been. She was&mdash;alas! for her&mdash;Philip Yates's wife, far from
any who could have aided her, even if she would have permitted
the slightest interposition in her fate. Doomed to
obey his commands, she was apparently ready enough to
gratify him, and managed, even in that secluded spot, to win
all the pleasure and cheerfulness out of her life which it was
possible to obtain.</p>

<p>She dressed herself, according to her promise. When her
toilet was completed, it was astonishing to see how brilliantly
she came out of the cloud which had appeared to envelop her.
Her face caught its most girlish expression&mdash;the large eyes
grew luminous&mdash;the smile about her mouth was playful and
sweet. Those tresses of billowy hair, woven in luxuriant braids
back of her head, would of themselves have relieved her face
from any charge of plainness.</p>

<p>This woman put out her candle and turned to the window.
For many moments she stood looking out into the glorious
night and watching every effect with the sensations an artist
could have understood.</p>

<p>Then, in spite of herself, back into the past fled her soul,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
and the chill waves of memory rushed over her. She flung
her white arms aloft, and cried out in her pain. Once more
that man's name died on her lips in a passionate echo, which
frightened even herself: "Laurence! Laurence!"</p>

<p>A burst of merriment from below recalled her to the present,
and the hard destiny which lay before her. With the
strong self-command acquired in her strange life, she banished
from her features every trace of care; the soft light crept into
her eyes again, the pleasant smile settled upon her lips.</p>

<p>She took from the table a thin blue scarf, and, flinging it
gracefully over her shoulders, as we see drapery in Guido's
pictures, passed down stairs toward the room where her
husband and his guests were seated, already, as she could
detect by the broken words which reached her ear, occupied
with the fatal games which had driven so many men to ruin
within those very walls.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">TWO CONFEDERATES, IN COUNCIL.</p>


<p>Philip Yates and his wife were sitting upon the veranda
of their house one pleasant evening, some time after the events
described in the last chapter.</p>

<p>He was in unusually good humor and fine spirits that night.
Probably, during the past weeks, his successes had been
numerous; and however much his wife might have deplored
the cause had she been a woman to feel the sin and degradation,
she could but have congratulated herself upon the effect
which it produced.</p>

<p>He was smoking and talking at intervals to Sybil, who sat
in a low chair at a little distance, looking down the valley
with the earnest, absent gaze habitual with her.</p>

<p>"Sing me something, Sybil," he said, at last; "it's deuced
dull sitting here alone. I can't see what keeps Tom."</p>

<p>"Do you expect him back to-night?" she asked, indifferently,
more as if fearful of offending him by her silence than
from any desire of her own for conversation.</p>

<p>"I did, but it is growing so late I begin to think he won't
come; it's always the way if one wants a man."</p>

<p>"You have no business on hand?"</p>

<p>"Not to-night; I need him for that very reason. What's
the use of a man's smoking his cigar and drinking his glass
all alone."</p>

<p>Sybil smiled, not bitterly even, with a sort of careless scorn,
which would have irritated the man had he seen it&mdash;but her
face was partially turned away; he saw only the outlines of
her colorless cheek, which took a singular grace and softness
in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"Are you going to sing?" he asked, after a moment's
silence, broken only by a malediction upon his cigar. "How
many times must one ask you to do a thing before you condescend
to pay attention?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>She made no answer, but began at once a Spanish song, in
a powerful contralto voice, which rung pleasantly through the
stillness, as if a score of birds in the neighboring almond
thicket had been awakened by the beauty of the night, and
were joining their notes in a delicious harmony.</p>

<p>When the song was finished she began another without
waiting for him to speak, and for a full half hour she continued
her efforts to amuse him, without the slightest appearance
of distaste or weariness.</p>

<p>Suddenly, another sound came up through the night&mdash;the
tread of heavy feet and voices, evidently approaching the
house.</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Yates, quickly. "Somebody is coming."</p>

<p>Sybil paused, with the words unfinished upon her lips, and
both listened intently.</p>

<p>"It must be Tom," exclaimed Philip; "nobody but he ever
whistles like that."</p>

<p>He listened for an instant longer, then called out:</p>

<p>"Hello, I say!"</p>

<p>The echo came back distinctly, then a human voice
answered the salutation.</p>

<p>"It is Tom," Yates said. "I hope to the Lord there's
somebody with him. I'm frantic to be at work."</p>

<p>Just then several figures became visible in a turn of the
path; Yates went down the steps and walked forward to meet
them, while Sybil leaned her cheek against the low railing and
looked quietly down, humming fragments of the air which her
husband had so unceremoniously interrupted.</p>

<p>Yates joined the party, and they stood for a few moments
in conversation; then the whole group moved toward the
house, Sybil watching them still with that careless yet singular
expression which few men could look upon without emotion.</p>

<p>There was no one with the new-comer, except two or three
of the men who were employed by Yates and his friend about
the place, more probably by way of making a security of
numbers than from any actual necessity that existed for their
services. These men passed toward another entrance, while
Yates and his companion ascended the steps of the veranda.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mrs. Yates," the man called out.</p>

<p>She answered his greeting civilly enough, but without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
changing her attitude, and began even whispering the pretty
song, as if she found something soothing in the simple words.</p>

<p>"You haven't had any supper, Tom?" Yates asked.</p>

<p>"None, and I am hungry as a wolf."</p>

<p>Yates went to the house door and called vigorously:</p>

<p>"Yuba! Yuba! you old fool, get supper ready at once."</p>

<p>When an answering cry assured him that his summons
had been heard and would receive attention, he brought from
the hall a japan tray, upon which were placed several bottles
and glasses.</p>

<p>"You may as well wet your throat, Tom, while you're
waiting for supper; it's deuced warm to-night."</p>

<p>The man assented with a guttural laugh, the two seated
themselves near the table on which Yates had placed the
waiter, and filled their glasses, clashing them against each
other.</p>

<p>"Will you have a little wine, Mrs. Yates?" asked the
stranger. "I know how you like it mixed."</p>

<p>But she declined the offer, leaned her head still lower upon
the railing, and looked away across the valley where the
moonlight played, far off in the very center of the flat, lying
so unbroken and silvery that it had the effect of a small lake
hidden among the great trees and luxuriant vines.</p>

<p>As the two men sat opposite each other, tilted back in their
great wicker-chairs, it was curious to notice the resemblance
between them. They might have been taken for twin
brothers, yet it was one of those accidental likenesses which
one occasionally sees in all countries. There was no tie of
blood between them, or any reason for this look of consanguinity.
The chances of their reckless lives had thrown them
together, a similarity of tastes and a series of mutual benefits
preserved the intimacy which had sprung up among the rank
weeds of human life.</p>

<p>Dickinson had not the claims to manly beauty which
Yates had once possessed, yet his features bore the same type
of countenance on a larger, coarser scale; but in form or
movement they were so much alike, that when their backs
were turned, it would have puzzled even a person who knew
them well to have told one from the other.</p>

<p>While they conversed, Sybil did not appear to listen, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
not a word escaped her vigilant ear, and sometimes she turned
her face partially, and flashed toward them that strange look
which so entirely changed the expression of her countenance.</p>

<p>"But I haven't heard what kept you all this while up at
the diggings," Yates was saying, as Sybil turned again toward
the table. "I know you haven't been at work&mdash;you're too
lazy for that, and too wise; fools work, and cute men, like
you and I, catch gold easier."</p>

<p>Dickinson laughed, and pulled out an old wallet, rattled the
coins which it contained, and held up to view a shot-bag,
apparently containing a large quantity of gold dust.</p>

<p>"All from a quiet game under a clump of myrtle bushes,"
he said, with another laugh.</p>

<p>"But that hasn't kept you all this time."</p>

<p>"No; I was over to Sancher's ranche. I knew there was
nothing going on here, and we are apt to get cross when it is
stupid&mdash;eh, Mrs. Yates?"</p>

<p>"Did you speak?" she asked, as if suddenly aroused by
his voice.</p>

<p>"I say Phil and I are not two angels for temper in dull
times; do you think so?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," she answered, good-naturedly enough; "fallen
angels, you know, twice degraded."</p>

<p>The men laughed heartily, and Dickinson gave her a glance
of honest admiration; she was evidently a woman for whom
he felt sincere respect&mdash;the sentiment which a dull rogue has
for a clear-headed, acute person whom he is willing to
acknowledge as his superior.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's of no use to clash tongues with you," he said.
"I learned that a great while ago."</p>

<p>Sybil rose from her seat, and walked slowly down the
veranda toward the door, paused an instant, flung back some
mocking speech in answer to his words and Philip's laugh,
and passed into the house.</p>

<p>"That's a wonderful woman!" exclaimed Dickinson, when
she had disappeared through the doorway. "I tell you what,
Phil, there ain't three men in California with a head-piece
equal to that on her handsome shoulders."</p>

<p>"She's well enough," replied Yates, carelessly; "it would
be odd if she hadn't learned a few things since the time she
married me, and took to life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"You be blessed!" retorted Tom. "Her head is a deuced
sight longer and clearer than yours. I tell you, a keen
woman like that is more than a match for any man."</p>

<p>"She had better not try any thing of that sort with me!"
exclaimed Yates, sullenly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense; she doesn't want to! I never saw a woman
more devoted to a fellow, or so ready to help him along in
every way. I tell you, I'm not very fond of chains or ministers,
but I'd get married in a legal way to-morrow if I could
find a female like her to yoke myself to."</p>

<p>"Wait till she's my widow, Tom," Yates replied, with a
laugh. "Sybil's well enough, but she'd play the deuce, like
any woman, if she dared. She knows better than to put on
any airs with me. If another sort of man owned her, he'd
see stars!"</p>

<p>"Oh, you're cross as a bear to her&mdash;I'll say that for you;
and you never had any more feeling, Phil Yates&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, Thomas, that will do. Drink before supper never
did suit your head&mdash;so just hush up!"</p>

<p>"Nonsense; don't let's have any of your confounded sneers.
A fellow can't speak without being treated to something of
the sort, and I hate it!"</p>

<p>He set his glass down on the table with an energy that
made the bottles dance; but Yates only laughed, and
Dickinson soon smoked himself into a state of reasonable
tranquillity.</p>

<p>Thus much of their conversation Sybil paused in the hall to
hear. She lifted her hand and shook it menacingly toward
her husband, while the fire kindled and leaped in her blue
eyes, rendering them ten times more cruel and ferocious than
anger can orbs of a darker color. But, after that momentary
spasm of anger, she passed on; and, as she walked slowly
back and forth through the silent rooms, the coldness and
quiet came back to her face.</p>

<p>"I've a bit of news, Phil," said Dickinson, after a few
moments, "and it is worth hearing."</p>

<p>"Tell it then, by all means."</p>

<p>"This isn't just the place. Who knows how many listeners
we may have?"</p>

<p>"Fiddlesticks! The men are busy eating, and the women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
looking at them. There's nobody to listen unless it be
Sybil&mdash;"</p>

<p>"She never takes the trouble," interrupted Tom. "If we
tell her a thing, well and good; if not, she never bothers her
head about the matter."</p>

<p>"I believe that is true. But what is your news?"</p>

<p>Dickinson rose and walked toward the hall, to be certain
that there was no intruder within hearing; then he returned
to the table and drew his chair close to that of his friend.</p>

<p>"It's that which kept me up at the diggings," said he. "I
wanted to hear all I could."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"There's a chap over at Scouter's Point that's come on
from San Francisco to attend to some claims for Wilmurt's
widow. He's sold out her right, and he's got the stuff in his
pocket&mdash;a good round sum it is, too!"</p>

<p>"Yes," Yates said, quietly, holding his glass up to the
moonlight, as if admiring the color of the liquor.</p>

<p>"He is coming on with his guide and servant to our diggings
on some business; and there's several chaps who know
him mean to take that opportunity to send away a lot of
nuggets and dust."</p>

<p>Yates set the glass down quickly, and leaned toward his
friend.</p>

<p>"Does he touch these?"</p>

<p>He made a motion as if shuffling a pack of cards; but
Dickinson shook his head.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of use. I saw a fellow that knows him well.
He's a New York lawyer that came out here on some business,
and took up this affair just for the fun of the thing, and so as
to have a chance to see the diggings."</p>

<p>"Then what's the use of talking about it," exclaimed Yates,
angrily, "if he won't drink or play?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Tom, artfully. "I told you of it
because I thought you would like to hear. You are always
complaining that we never have any adventure, and that you
might as well be promenading Broadway for all the sport
there is to be found."</p>

<p>Yates whistled an opera air, from beginning to end, in the
most elaborate manner. At the close he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>"When will he be at the diggings?"</p>

<p>"Day after to-morrow, at the latest."</p>

<p>"This is Monday, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Of course it is."</p>

<p>"I wasn't certain. One fairly loses the day of the week in
this confounded desert. Monday be it. On Wednesday he
will reach the diggings."</p>

<p>"Yes; he means to stay there a couple of days."</p>

<p>"On Saturday, then, he will pass through the valley."</p>

<p>"Exactly so, Philip. Your arithmetic is wonderful."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it. I may be professor in a college yet!"</p>

<p>"He will have to stop here all night, for he can't leave the
diggings before noon. Old Jones asked me if I thought you
would keep him."</p>

<p>"What did you say?"</p>

<p>"That you didn't keep a tavern, and that your wife was
mighty particular. But if he was a gentleman, I didn't suppose
either you or she would send him on after dark."</p>

<p>"No," said Yates; "oh no!"</p>

<p>"There'll be a crowd in the valley," continued Dickinson.
"There's more gold been dug these last days than there has
in months, and they'll be down to the tents and over here to
get rid of it, you may bet your life."</p>

<p>"So be it," returned Yates. "They couldn't dispose of it
to more worthy people."</p>

<p>Then they laughed immoderately, as if the words had covered
an excellent jest. Before the conversation could be
resumed, a dwarfish old Indian woman, who was a miracle
of ugliness, appeared at the door and announced that their
supper was waiting.</p>

<p>"Come in, Tom," said Yates, rising with the utmost
alacrity. "I couldn't eat any dinner for lack of company.
You know Sybil picks like a sparrow&mdash;and I shall be glad of
something myself."</p>

<p>They passed into the house, and, at Dickinson's request,
Sybil was summoned to grace the board with her presence.
She complied with her customary obedience; but during the
repast no allusion was made to the stranger or the ambiguous
conversation which had been held on the porch a little while
before.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A SHORT RIDE AND A LONG WALK.</p>


<p>Two days passed without any event worthy of record.
Every thing at the ranche went on quietly enough, and a
stranger happening there might have believed it an orderly
and well regulated family as any that could be found in the
State.</p>

<p>The two men held long conversations in private. Even
Sybil was not made acquainted with their cause; and although
she was too acute not to have perceived that there was a
secret from which she was excluded, she betrayed neither
interest nor curiosity, evidently quite willing to allow affairs
to take their own course, and await the pleasure of her husband
and his confederate to hear a disclosure of the scheme
which they might be revolving in their minds.</p>

<p>On the third day the two made preparations to go up to
the mines. Yates owned a claim which he did not work
himself, for labor was not a thing he actually enjoyed, but he
had hired men to work it, being able, even in that rage for
gold which had taken possession of all, to find men who
preferred secure daily wages to the uncertainty of working
upon their own account.</p>

<p>Yates was in the habit of making weekly visits to the
place, so that Sybil received the information of the departure
as a matter of course, and supper was prepared before sunset,
that they might make their journey during the cool of the
evening.</p>

<p>The mules were brought out, and Sybil followed her husband
and his friend out on to the veranda to see them mount
and ride away.</p>

<p>"You will have a beautiful night," she said. "The wind
blows cool and refreshing."</p>

<p>"You had better ride a little way with us, Mrs. Yates,"
said Dickinson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>"I would, but I have a headache," she answered, sweetly.</p>

<p>"Now, why can't you be honest and say you are glad to
see us start?" returned her husband.</p>

<p>"Because I never tell stories," she replied, with her pleasant
laugh; "I was always taught to consider it wicked."</p>

<p>"What heavenly principles!" sneered Yates. "I declare,
Sybil, you are too good for this world."</p>

<p>"Well," exclaimed Tom, "she's needed in it, anyhow!
Smart, handsome women are too scarce for her to be spared."</p>

<p>Sybil swept him a courtesy, and Yates laughed outright.</p>

<p>"Tom waxes gallant," said he. "You ought to be grateful,
Syb, for his compliments. He isn't given to flattering
you women, I can tell you."</p>

<p>"I am very grateful," she replied, giving Tom one of her
flashing glances. "Admiration is as rare a thing in this
region as Mr. Dickinson considers bright women."</p>

<p>Tom was quite abashed; like many another bad man, he
was never at ease in the presence of a well-bred woman&mdash;and
that Sybil was a lady no one could have denied; it was perceptible
in every word and movement.</p>

<p>Yates had to go through his usual routine of maledictions
upon his servants and mules; then he mounted his own particular
beast, blew a kiss to Sybil, and called out:</p>

<p>"Come, Tom, are you going to stand all night flirting with
my wife, I should like to know?"</p>

<p>"What abominable things you do say!" exclaimed Tom,
coloring like a girl, and making all haste to get on to his
mule, by way of covering his confusion.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Dickinson," said Sybil, "I would not have
believed you so ungallant!"</p>

<p>"As how?" questioned Tom.</p>

<p>"You said that it was an abominable thing to admire me.
Really, I am astonished!"</p>

<p>"That wasn't what I meant," he replied. "But you know
I never can say what I want to, I'm such a stupid fool of a
fellow&mdash;always was, among women folks."</p>

<p>"There, Tom, that will do! You have got out of the
scrape beautifully," said Yates, lending his friend's mule
a cut with his black whip. "You have danced attendance
on the Graces long enough for one day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>The mule started off with Dickinson, at a sharp canter,
and deprived him of an opportunity to reply even if he had
wished it. Yates gathered up his reins, nodded to Sybil, and
prepared to follow.</p>

<p>"When shall I expect you?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow night, at the furtherest. I only want to see
how the men get on."</p>

<p>"Good-by, then, till to-morrow."</p>

<p>He rode away, and Sybil stood watching them for some
time; but her face had lost the sweet expression which
possessed so great a charm for Dickinson.</p>

<p>"How long must this continue?" she muttered. "Will
there never be an end? Oh, Sybil&mdash;Sybil! what a weak,
miserable fool you have been! This is the end of your art
and talent&mdash;a home in the wilderness, a gambler's wife! But
it shall change&mdash;oh! it shall change, I say!"</p>

<p>She clasped her hands hard over her heart, gave one other
glance toward the retreating riders, and entered the house.
She went up to her own room, and remained there a long
time.</p>

<p>At length she rose and glanced out of the window. The
sun had set, and the twilight would have been gloomy and
gray but for a faint glory heralding the moon which had not
yet appeared in sight over the towering mountains.</p>

<p>"I must be gone!" she exclaimed. "I can not bear this
any longer&mdash;I should go crazy!"</p>

<p>She went to a chest of drawers that stood in a corner of
the room, unlocked them, and took out a small and richly
mounted revolver&mdash;one of those charming death trifles that
Col. Colt has fashioned so exquisitely. It was so elaborate in
its workmanship, and so delicately pretty, that it looked rather
like a plaything than the dangerous implement it really was.
But, small and fanciful as it was, the weapon would have been
a dangerous instrument in the hands of that woman had
interest or self-preservation rendered it necessary for her to
use it.</p>

<p>She loaded the several barrels with dexterity and quickness,
which betrayed a perfect knowledge of her task, locked
the drawers again, and hid the pistol in her pocket.</p>

<p>She put on a pretty gipsy hat, threw a mantle over her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
shoulders, and went out of her room, locking the door behind
her that any one who chanced to try the door might suppose
her occupied within. Down stairs she stole with her quick,
stealthy tread, passed through the hall, and saw the men-servants
at their supper in the kitchen, with the two Indian
women obediently attending to their wants.</p>

<p>She gave one glance, retraced her steps, hurried out of the
front door, and followed the path opposite that which her
husband and his companion had taken an hour before.</p>

<p>She was speedily concealed from the view of those within
the house by a thicket of almond-trees, and passed fearlessly
and rapidly along the path which she had trodden in many a
long walk when the wretched isolation of her life had become
unendurable.</p>

<p>The night came on; the moon was up, giving forth a brilliant
but fitful light, for a great troop of clouds were sweeping
through the sky and at intervals obscured her beams completely,
leaving only traces of struggling light on the edges of
the clouds.</p>

<p>The path was rugged and broken&mdash;a greater portion of the
way led through a heavy forest; but Sybil walked quickly on,
disturbed by none of the forest-sounds which might have terrified
a less determined woman from following out the end
she had set her heart upon.</p>

<p>The wind sighed mournfully among the great trees over
her head and dashed the swaying vines against her face; but
she resolutely pushed them aside and forced for herself a passage.
Lonely night-birds sent forth their cries, so like human
wails that they were fairly startling; noisome reptiles, disturbed
by her approach, slid away through the gloom with
venomous hisses; but still Sybil passed on, upright, defiant,
her hand clenching the weapon concealed in her dress with a
tight grasp, and her eyes flashing with the fearful enjoyment
which the scene produced upon her mind, to which excitement
was necessary as oxygen is to the air.</p>

<p>It would have been a singular study, the manner in which
this woman's determination overcame her physical cowardice
when any cause for prompt action was presented to her.
Upon ordinary occasions nothing could have induced her to
enter that wood after nightfall; but, under the influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
insane desire which had been upon her for days, she trod its
recesses as untremblingly as the boldest pioneer who ever
crossed the Rocky Mountains could have done.</p>

<p>The greater portion of her way led along the bank of the
stream, which flowed in the woods after breaking through the
heart of the valley and forcing its way between the narrow of
the mountains, that gave it an unwilling egress. The waters
rung pleasantly in the shadow, but Sybil did not pause to
listen, although her rare nature contained enough of ideality
to have led her away into many a romance, had she been
thrown among these picturesque shades when her mind was
at rest.</p>

<p>It was a weary walk, but in her excitement Sybil thought
little of the fatigue. She reached the end of her journey, at
length. It was the ranche to which she had directed the
party who came with that wounded man to ask shelter of
her. Sybil did not go directly to the house. At a considerable
distance from the dwelling was a rude hut where the
family of one of the workmen lived. Sybil knew the woman;
she had once taken a fancy to be very kind to a sick child of
the poor creature, and that favor had never been forgotten.</p>

<p>When Sybil knocked at the door, a querulous voice bade
her enter, and she went into the miserable abode. The
woman was nursing her baby, and two older children sat
crouching at her feet, munching black crusts of bread with
the sharp appetite which follows a long fast. The room was
so bare that it could hardly be called untidy; but the appearance
of the female and her children was famished and
miserable enough.</p>

<p>She started up&mdash;a haggard, raw-boned creature&mdash;with a cry
at the sight of her visitor, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Mrs. Yates!"</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Sybil, motioning her back. "I want to ask
you a few questions, about which you are to say nothing to
any living soul."</p>

<p>"I will," replied the woman. "You were good to my
boy. I don't forget that."</p>

<p>Sybil waved that claim to consideration carelessly aside,
and went on:</p>

<p>"There was a party of strangers at the house one night
last week?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said the woman; "I was up at the ranche when
they come in; they had been to your place, and said you
wouldn't let them stop. I didn't believe it."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Sybil, breathlessly; she had waited for
nearly a week to gain information&mdash;waited with the patience
which was one of her most remarkable characteristics; but
now that the moment was at hand, she could hardly give
the woman time to speak.</p>

<p>"One of the gentlemen had a hurt&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was the doctor here?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it wasn't nothing but a sprain."</p>

<p>"You are certain?"</p>

<p>"Sartin of it, ma'am. They staid here that night and the
next; he was quite well by that time, and then they went on&mdash;that's
all I know about them; I wish it was more, if it could
oblige you."</p>

<p>"That is enough," said Sybil.</p>

<p>She appeared satisfied; she had walked five miles through
the forest to obtain those meager crumbs of information&mdash;braved
dangers from which even a man might have shrunk;
but in that lonely, miserable life of hers, it was something
even to have gained those brief tidings.</p>

<p>A few more questions she asked: how the gentleman
looked; if he had quite recovered; if the woman had heard
him speak.</p>

<p>"Pretty much, ma'am, and he seemed as full of fun as a
boy; I guess he didn't mind. Oh, them that's rich can afford
to be funny, and folks say he's got a mighty heap of gold."</p>

<p>Sybil made no answer to the woman's remark, but sat for
a time in silence, looking straight before her after her old
fashion.</p>

<p>"I wish I could give you a bite to eat or drink," said the
woman, "but we hain't got a living thing."</p>

<p>Sybil roused herself at once.</p>

<p>"I am in want of nothing," she said; "I must go home
now."</p>

<p>"Dear me, you ain't rested; it's a hard ride."</p>

<p>Sybil did not inform her that she had come alone and on
foot. She placed some money in the woman's hand, and said
kindly, but with emphasis:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"You need not say that I have been here."</p>

<p>"Nobody'll ask," replied the woman; "if they did, it
wouldn't do no good&mdash;I hain't forgot! Oh, ma'am, I ain't a
good woman; I'm a poor, ignorant, bad-tempered critter,
that Joe often says would be better off in my grave; but
God bless you, that can't do you no harm, forlorn as I be.
God bless you, ma'am!"</p>

<p>Sybil hurried away to escape the wound these words gave
her. Her better feelings were aroused, and somehow that
simple, uncouth benediction jarred upon her ear; it made her
more nervous than she had been while threading her way
through the lonely woods, and she hastened out into the night
once more.</p>

<p>A change had passed over the sky; great masses of heavy
clouds were piled up against the horizon and scattered over
the heavens, through which the moon rushed in frightened
haste. The wind had fallen, and an oppressive sultriness
superseded the cool of the woods which had been so apparent
a few hours before. Once or twice distant peals of thunder
rolled afar off, and the jagged edges of the precipice of clouds
were colored with blue lightning.</p>

<p>Sybil struck into the path and took her way homeward.
The feeling which supported her had in a measure subsided, and
the fears natural to a place and scene like that began to force
themselves on her imagination.</p>

<p>Since the day that Laurence and his party stopped at her
house, she had been half mad to learn if his injury had proved
of little consequence, and if he had been enabled to pursue
his journey. There was no one at the ranche whom she
dared to trust; for well she knew, although he had not again
alluded to the subject, that her husband was watching every
movement, and that the slightest show of anxiety on her part
would be followed by a repetition of cruelties that since her
marriage and removal to that wild place had been of frequent
occurrence. She was afraid of this now, and fear took its
usual result, craft and concealment. She had borne her fears
and suffering in silence up to this time; but when Yates left
home, so keen was her anxiety that she could not have lived
another hour without starting forth to obtain such information
as could be gathered; had the distance been quadrupled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
she would have undertaken the journey, for in that mood
no danger or fatigue could have deterred her.</p>

<p>Long before Sybil reached the edge of the forest the clouds
had gathered force, and swept up to the very zenith; suddenly
the moon plunged down behind them, and the woods
were buried in darkness. The thunder pealed out again, rolling
and booming through the heavens like parks of artillery;
terrible flashes of lightning ran like fiery serpents through
the clouds, and made every object fearfully distinct. Every
shrub and tree took spectral shapes. The path seemed to
lose itself in dizzy windings, and Sybil could only cover her
face with both hands and rush blindly on, terrified but still
courageous.</p>

<p>Great drops of rain began to fall; the thunder increased in
violence, and the lightning flashes succeeded each other in
such rapid succession that the whole forest was wrapped in
flame. Still Sybil hurried on, panting for breath, half crazed
with fear, and keeping the path more from instinct than any
thought or power of reason.</p>

<p>The storm grew stronger, gathered its mighty powers
among the gorges, and surged up into one of those fearful
tempests which desolate mountain regions so suddenly. The
wind howled through the forest, the thunder pealed and
broke directly overhead, and renewed lightning leaped
and blazed before her very eyes till she was blinded and
stunned. There was no hope of shelter; the thickets which
lined the path might conceal wild beasts, frightened into
seeking refuge within their depths, but to her they threatened
death; she could only totter on, feeling her strength
fail with every gust of the storm beat against her. Many
times her feet struck against fragments of broken rocks,
or became entangled in the rank vines, which brought her
heavily to the ground, tearing her garments and bruising her
limbs; but in her fright and anguish she did not heed the
pain, and, catching at the branches for support, would stagger
to her feet again, and plunge on through the darkness, growing
more and more desperate each moment. Her drenched
garments clung about her form like a shroud&mdash;the cold touch
made her shudder; and when, in a sudden pause of the
tempest, a great owl rushed past her with his ill-omened cry,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
her senses almost forsook her in the fright. She heard the
cracking of branches, the thunder of giant trees, as they came
crashing to the earth, and their mangled boughs fell close
to her as she tottered on. Long briars, blown out into the
road, tore her face and pierced her arms; she shrieked with
fear as she forced herself away from their clutches, that
were like the talons of wild animals tearing at her life.</p>

<p>The tempest was of short duration; suddenly as it had sprung
up the wind died in the depths of the forest; the rain ceased;
the black wall of clouds tottered and crumbled against the
horizon, breaking away like mountains in a dream.</p>

<p>As Sybil left the wood, the moon soared up again from the
prison of clouds where it had been confined, and the night
grew serene and quiet, as if no blast had swept through it.</p>

<p>Feeble, weary and faint, Sybil toiled on until she reached
her home. The lights were out, the doors fastened, but she
had means of entrance, and made her way up to her chamber
so stealthily that even the great dogs who bayed and kept
watch upon the veranda were not disturbed by her tread.</p>

<p>Once in her room, and feeling that she was safe, the desperation
that had nerved her gave way, and she fell a dead
weight upon the floor. She had not fainted, but it was a
long time before she could find strength to rise; her limbs
were stiffened&mdash;her very heart was chilled. She could only
lie there, staring out at the moon, while her troubled senses
heard still the roar of the tempest, and dismal shapes came
out of the gloom to torture her more sorely than the storm
had done&mdash;cold specters from the past that refused to lie
quiet in their graves; painful memories, blighted hopes&mdash;every
sight and sound from which her tortured soul strove to escape
but had no power&mdash;she could only look through her strained,
glaring eyes, and watch the pale procession in its course.</p>

<p>She shook off the weakness and that terrible fear, at last;
struggled to her feet, threw off her drenched garments, and
crept into bed chilled and trembling, only to renew in sleep
the mournful images from which she had tried to escape
during her waking hours.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE WELCOME THAT AWAITS RALPH HINCHLEY.</p>


<p>On the appointed day, Yates and his companion returned
home. Sybil went down to meet them as calm and smiling
as though the season of their absence had been fraught with
no incident of interest, or no terrible conflict had shaken her
whole soul to its center. True, very little had happened in
acts; but the greatest changes of life occur when all is still.
Supper was over, and Sybil had gone up to her room, leaving
the two men smoking upon the veranda. There was a low,
eager conversation between them after her departure. At
length Dickinson raised his voice:</p>

<p>"You had better go now and talk to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, these women," muttered Yates; "there's no telling
how she may take any thing."</p>

<p>"She'll take it as you would," replied Dickinson. "Be
careful how you tell your story&mdash;don't frighten her at first.
Why, you may bring a woman to any thing if you don't
upset her nerves at the start."</p>

<p>"You are wonderfully wise," mused Yates.</p>

<p>Tom did not seem inclined to provoke a discussion, and
after a little hesitation Yates went into the house and mounted
the stairs.</p>

<p>He entered Sybil's chamber abruptly, and found her, as
usual, seated in a low chair by the window.</p>

<p>"I want to talk to you a little," he said, "and I expect you
to act like a sensible woman."</p>

<p>"Let me hear," she answered.</p>

<p>"It's a short story," said he, bluntly. "To-morrow night,
then, a man will stop here loaded with money and dust
enough to make us all rich for the rest of our lives."</p>

<p>"Well?" The red lips lost their color, and shut hard
together; that cruel light shot into the blue eyes.</p>

<p>"It isn't well," retorted Yates, angrily. "He won't drink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
and he won't gamble; so what's to be done? Tom talks
about taking the fellow in hand."</p>

<p>"No, no," interrupted Sybil, putting up her hands as if to
shut out some horrible object. "I have not forgotten San
Francisco&mdash;don't talk of it, Philip."</p>

<p>"I knew that would be the way!" he exclaimed. "I
was a fool to tell you of it. No woman can be trusted when
it comes to the pinch; but that goose, Tom, said you would
take it kindly, and be the first to hit on some plan that would
settle every thing."</p>

<p>"I will help you as I always have," she said, trembling
violently; "but not that&mdash;oh! heavens, no."</p>

<p>"There, there, you foolish child!" he replied, not ill-naturedly.
"That wasn't your fault or mine; the men got
to quarreling in the house, and we killed the other&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But it was so terrible; that dying man's face has haunted
me ever since&mdash;I can see his eyes glaring, and hear his breath
struggling and gurgling yet&mdash;see him clutching and tearing at
the bed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't, for God's sake!" he exclaimed, catching hold of
her; "you'll drive a man mad!"</p>

<p>She had risen from her seat, and was pointing wildly at
the floor as she spoke, but his voice seemed to recall her to
herself. She sunk back into her chair panting for breath,
while Yates vainly endeavored to conceal his own discomposure.</p>

<p>"You will go crazy in one of these abominable fits," he
said, brushing his hand across his forehead, and sweeping the
great drops of perspiration away.</p>

<p>"Then don't bring such memories back," she shuddered.</p>

<p>After all, the woman was the first to regain her usual manner,
while Yates walked slowly up and down the room, his
mind divided between the recollections her words had aroused
and the plans which had been arranged during the past
days.</p>

<p>"So we must give it up," he said, at length, "and all for
your confounded folly."</p>

<p>"Do you call it folly?" cried Sybil, with a miserable
specter of a laugh.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do! There is one thing certain; your obstinacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and cowardice will lengthen your stay here by ten good
years."</p>

<p>"I am not a coward&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Call yourself what you please! I say, before we can
afford to leave this place, the youth will be gone out of your
face, the brightning from your eyes&mdash;you'll be an old woman,
Sybil."</p>

<p>She did not appear moved by his threats, and, as was customary
with him when thwarted, he began to pass into a
violent rage. She did not answer the harsh words and maledictions
which he heaped upon her; but once, when he made
a movement as if to give her a blow, as had often happened
before, she turned upon him with something in her face from
which he shrunk in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"Don't do that!" she exclaimed, in an awful whisper; "I
warn you never to attempt that again!"</p>

<p>The victory was more nearly won to her than it had been
for many a day. Yates dropped his hand and turned to go
out.</p>

<p>"Well, let every thing slide," he said; "this comes of trusting
a woman with secrets! I must sit in my chair and see
sixty thousand dollars good slip out of my hands, and Ralph
Hinchley go by without lifting a finger."</p>

<p>Sybil sprung forward and clutched his arm; the face she
bent toward him was like that of a corpse.</p>

<p>"Speak that name again," she whispered; "speak it."</p>

<p>"Ralph Hinchley," he repeated, pushing her aside with a
feeling like absolute fear. "Confound you, what do you look
like that for?"</p>

<p>Sybil still held him fast, and her voice rung out hollow and
unnatural:</p>

<p>"Why, if you murder him, I will avenge it; so God help us
both!"</p>

<p>"What is he to you? Do you know him?"</p>

<p>She forced back the whirlwind of passion, and stood up,
cold and white.</p>

<p>"I never saw him," she replied; "but if you wish his
money, I shall not stand between you and him; his life
you shall not take."</p>

<p>"Are you in earnest?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>She answered him with a look.</p>

<p>"But we have not settled on that; I propose to
follow him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Fools!" exclaimed Sybil. "To-morrow night the house
and the valley will be full of mad and drunken men. There
may be half a dozen robberies&mdash;will one more make any great
difference?"</p>

<p>"What a woman you are!" exclaimed Yates, with that
sort of admiring dread with which a bad man watches a
superior in coldness and courage. "It will be impossible to say
who did it! What a mind you have when it works in
earnest."</p>

<p>"There will be a score of people here wanting lodgings
to-morrow night; surely, your way is clear."</p>

<p>She waved him impatiently off when he would have
pursued the subject.</p>

<p>"Go down stairs," she said; "I am tired of this. I am
coming in a moment."</p>

<p>He went out. She stood still in the gloom, while that
terrible look of ferocity came back to her face.</p>

<p>"Either of them, or both," she muttered; "I don't care!
Hinchley is Margaret's cousin&mdash;Sybil Yates will save him;
but not till they have gone far enough to prove the attempt.
Then let them arrest Philip if they will&mdash;oh! I am sick
of this life, and do so loathe him."</p>

<p>She swept out of the room, cold and stern as a Nemesis,
descending to the presence of those men who sat together
whispering of things which they dared not speak aloud.
They had excited themselves with drink; but Sybil was not
afraid to look the reality in the face&mdash;her resolve was taken,
she would not falter. If she reasoned with her conscience it
was thus: "The plan is not mine&mdash;I could not help it.
These men are false and desperate; I can guide but not
defeat them. When it is done&mdash;oh, how my heart beats; its
chains are falling off. His petty sins shall bind me here no
longer."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ARRIVAL OF THE GUEST.</p>


<p>It was Saturday evening; the moon rose upon a scene
which utterly changed the whole aspect of the ranche.</p>

<p>Since early in the afternoon the road from the mines had
been filled with men, who poured down into the valley to
seek relaxation after their week's successful toil, and relieve
themselves, perhaps, of every ounce of the yellow dust which
they had labored so hard to gain.</p>

<p>About the tents and cabins were grouped scores of men
from every nation of the civilized world. Long tables had
been set out in the open air, covered with such food as the
owners of the huts could procure; barrels of liquor were
standing under the trees, ready broached, and moist at the
tap from frequent applications.</p>

<p>A great fire had been kindled near the cabins, at which
quarters of beef, joints of venison, and groups of wild game
were roasting with a slow success that filled the air with
appetizing odors. In fact, the whole valley took the appearance
of a political barbecue or gipsy encampment. The
miners, in the slouched hats, red shirts, and muddy boots, gave
picturesque effect to the scene which a philosopher would
have condemned and an artist forgiven at the first glance.</p>

<p>The ranche had its full share of visitors; food and drink
were bountifully provided. Yates and Dickinson moved
about among the men, excited by liquor and evil passions,
and urging them on to every species of excess, like fiends
seeking to drag down humanity to their own base level.</p>

<p>Secure in her chamber, Sybil listened to the tumult and
smiled quietly. She really had something in common with
Lucretia Borgia besides the golden tint in her hair. She was
neither shocked nor afraid; but had grown so accustomed to
such scenes that they no longer had any power to affect her.</p>

<p>She was sitting by her window, and looking toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
path which led from the mountains, so absorbed in thought
that she scarcely heard the shouts and hideous din which
ascended from below.</p>

<p>At last she beheld two men on horseback coming down the
declivity, preceded by a guide. No trace of exultation lit up
her features; the face grew more hard and stern; the peculiar
look which gave such age to her countenance settled over its
whiteness&mdash;that was all. She clenched her hands on the
window-sill, and watched their approach.</p>

<p>"Margaret's cousin," she whispered, once; "well, hereafter
in my dreams I shall be worthy her thanks&mdash;she was fond
of him&mdash;shedding tears&mdash;yes, yes, it is my turn now!"</p>

<p>The men rode slowly on, and as they reached the foot of
the mountain, and the demoniac scene, lighted by the moon
and the glare of the camp-fires, burst upon them, they simultaneously
checked their horses, and looked at each other in
horrified astonishment.</p>

<p>"Great heavens, what a sight!" exclaimed Hinchley.</p>

<p>"It's like going down into purgatory," muttered the domestic.
"Shall we have to spend the night here, Mr. Hinchley?"</p>

<p>"You can't do no better," interrupted the guide; "it's the
same thing clear to Wilson's ranche. You'll do well enough
at Phil Yates's; he promised you rooms and beds to yourselves&mdash;you'd
best come on."</p>

<p>The guide looked eagerly about as he spoke, his savage
nature in a state of pleasurable excitement, and anxious to join
the desperate crowds that were scattered through the valley.</p>

<p>"I wish we had stopped at the diggings," Hinchley said.</p>

<p>The guide had stepped away from them, and they conversed
for a few seconds in private.</p>

<p>"Luckily, nobody knows we've got the money and dust
with us," said the man.</p>

<p>"That is true. I dare say we are quite as safe in this
crowd as we should be alone with the people that live at Wilson's
house. You must keep a good look-out all night, Martin;
I will see that our rooms are close together. If we are assailed
we must do our best."</p>

<p>There was no time for further conversation; the guide
summoned them impatiently, and they rode on toward the
ranche, passing several camp-fires about which were grouped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
evil-looking men drinking and gambling, some upon the
ground, some upon the newly-made stumps from which the
forest-trees had been cut.</p>

<p>Nobody paid much attention to them, and they passed on
up to the house, where Yates received them with a rough
courtesy which was in a measure reassuring, compared with
the appearance of the crowds they had seen.</p>

<p>"You have hit on a bad night," he said, as he conducted
them into the house; "but I will give you rooms up stairs&mdash;you
will be quiet enough there."</p>

<p>"Show us to them at once," said Hinchley; "I am fairly
sick with this disgusting scene."</p>

<p>"I used to feel so," returned Yates; "but a man gets
accustomed to any thing in these regions."</p>

<p>He led them through the hall and up the stairs, the servant
carrying the saddle-bags and packages. They were shown
into a comfortable room, which, in comparison with the scene
they had left, appeared like a palace.</p>

<p>"You will do very well here," said Yates. "That next
room is for your man. I'll have some supper sent up to you.
I don't keep a tavern, nay how, but those rascals below would
tear my house down about my ears if I refused them admittance.
It's nothing when you are acquainted with California
life."</p>

<p>"I'm blessed if I don't hope my acquaintance'll be a short
one," muttered Martin.</p>

<p>Yates laughed as he left the room, and Hinchley threw
himself into a chair, wearied with many days' privation and
hard riding.</p>

<p>"I guess we're safe enough here," said Martin.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I apprehend no danger at all."</p>

<p>While they waited for their supper, and listened to the
horrible din below, Yates went on to the room where Sybil
was seated.</p>

<p>"They have come," he whispered, going close to where
she sat.</p>

<p>"I know it," she replied, quietly.</p>

<p>"You don't feel afraid, Sybil? You won't draw back?"</p>

<p>"I?" she laughed, in her scornful way.</p>

<p>"Stop that noise!" exclaimed Yates, with a menacing
gesture; "you laugh like a ghost."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Mad as he was with liquor and evil passions, there was
something so unnatural in that sound that it half sobered him.</p>

<p>While they stood eyeing each other, the door opened, and
Dickinson reeled into the room.</p>

<p>"Come down stairs, Phil," he said; "there'll have to be
another barrel of whisky got out."</p>

<p>"You are drunk," said the other.</p>

<p>"A man needs to be," he shivered. "Good heavens, Mrs.
Yates, how you look!"</p>

<p>"Never mind that," she answered. "Go, both of you, and
do your best to keep that crowd of demons occupied."</p>

<p>"They are mighty good-natured with us," said Tom.
"That idea of yours, Sybil, of giving them the liquor, has set
us up wonderfully; hark! they're cheering Phil now."</p>

<p>Sybil flung up the window, and leaned over the sill, as
shout after shout arose like the yelling of fiends.</p>

<p>Dickinson pulled her hastily back.</p>

<p>"Don't let them see you&mdash;no woman would be safe! I
have told everybody you had gone down to Featherstone's."</p>

<p>"No, keep yourself close, Sybil," said Yates.</p>

<p>"Do not fear for me; go down stairs, both of you. I want
to be alone."</p>

<p>"What time do you think&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was Dickinson who began to speak; she checked the
broken utterance with a look.</p>

<p>"At the time I appointed; half past one."</p>

<p>She looked from one to the other, but neither of those
hardened men had the nerve to meet her eyes. They shrunk
out of the room in silence, without another word being spoken,
and once more Sybil was alone.</p>

<p>The riot and confusion increased. Men rushed about like
demons, singing, shouting, and clashing their cups together.
The veranda and grass in front were covered with poor
wretches, who had fallen there in their intoxication, and were
recklessly trampled upon by their companions. Yells and
shrieks went up, shot after shot was fired, knives gleamed in
the starlight, more than one fierce contest occurred, but through
it all that woman sat at her window and waited, appalled
neither by the horror of the scene, nor the fearful thoughts
which surged through her soul.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE GAMBLER'S FATE.</p>


<p>It was long past midnight, and something of quiet had
stolen over the valley; yet that very stillness, taken in connection
with the scene, was more impressive than the riot and
tumult had been.</p>

<p>The lower rooms of Yates's dwelling were in a state of
confusion beyond description. Glasses, dishes and broken
food had been swept to the floor to give place to cards and
dice, which began the instant the wolf-like appetites of the
men had been satisfied. The floor was covered with broken
bottles and saturated with liquor and costly wines; here and
there darker stains gleamed in the moonlight, betraying where
some deadly fray had ended just short of murder. Men lay
stretched upon the tables in heavy slumber, huddled among
the chairs and under the benches, either asleep or so deeply
intoxicated as to be unconscious of their degradation. Here
and there scattered gold shone out from the stains and pools
of wine, and a few wretches groped about picking up stray
nuggets or scraping together the saturated gold-dust and
hiding it in their garments.</p>

<p>In some of the rooms groups of men were still busy over
the cards, but even these had relapsed into quiet; nothing
was heard but the rattle of the dice or an occasional oath from
the lips of some ruined gambler.</p>

<p>Out of doors the scene was still different. The whole
length of the valley could be commanded in one view&mdash;the
smouldering camp-fires; men lying stretched upon the trampled
grass; poor wretches, wounded in the quarrels, who had dragged
themselves under the shadow of the great trees to bind up
their wounds or seek the slumber of exhaustion and spent
passions. Over all shone the moon, pouring down a cloud
of silvery radiance upon the repulsive scene, and rendering it
more horrible from the pure contrast.</p>

<p>At one of the card-tables Yates was still seated, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Dickinson hovered about, unable to remain quiet for a moment,
and, in spite of his partial intoxication, haggard and pale at
the recollection of the deed yet to be performed.</p>

<p>A meaning glance from Yates sent him out of the room.
Very soon his confederate flung down the cards, and, relinquishing
his place to some other sleepless desperado, made
his way among the forms huddled upon the floor, and passed
into the hall.</p>

<p>No one was watching; the stillness deepened each instant.
Up the stairs passed the two men, and entered the room
where Sybil awaited them.</p>

<p>Few words passed among them, but the woman was much
less shaken than either of those bold men. They stood for a
short time conversing in broken whispers; then Yates turned
quickly aside, moved to the end of the room where a tall
wardrobe was placed. A single touch upon a secret spring,
and the heavy piece of furniture swung noiselessly out, affording
admittance to the chamber beyond.</p>

<p>Ralph Hinchley started from a troubled dream to feel a
strange oppression upon his chest&mdash;a sweet, sickening odor
pervading the atmosphere&mdash;and to see through the open door
Martin lying upon the bed with a man bending over him and
pressing a napkin close against his face.</p>

<p>He started up in bed, unable to realize whether it was real
or only another wild vision. A blow from an unseen hand
dashed him back upon the pillow; but as he fell, with a
smothered cry, he saw a white face bending over him, and in
the doorway a woman enveloped in a mantle, which concealed
her features and most of her person, uttering cries
for help.</p>

<p>He started up again with frantic violence, shrieking out his
servant's name:</p>

<p>"Martin! Martin!"</p>

<p>He heard a cry from the woman:</p>

<p>"Help! help!"</p>

<p>Then his assailant sprung upon him. Hinchley grappled
him with all the fury of desperation, and the two rolled over
and over in deadly strife. The man who had kept guard by
the servant's bed escaped at the first tumult; but those two
men continued that fearful conflict. Hinchley was a brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
man; the belief that his life was at stake gave him the
strength of a tiger. He shrieked for help in a voice which
rung through the house and roused even the intoxicated
sleepers below.</p>

<p>There was a sound in the halls of eager voices and rapid
feet. Hinchley's assailant tried to dash him to the floor and
escape; but those long, slender arms seemed made of iron,
and held him pinioned.</p>

<p>At that moment the servant woke from the stupor, which
had only taken a partial effect upon his senses, and sprung up
with a mad cry.</p>

<p>"Help, Martin, help!" shrieked Hinchley, feeling his strength
begin to fail. "Come, I say!"</p>

<p>Half stupefied as he was, the man comprehended his master's
danger, rushed upon their foe, and hurled him back
upon the floor just as he succeeded in escaping from
Hinchley's hold.</p>

<p>This instant the door was broken open, and a crowd of
infuriated men rushed into the chamber, roused by those
shrieks for aid.</p>

<p>A few quick words explained the whole affair. The troop
pushed Hinchley and his servant back, seized the man and
dragged him toward the window. The moonlight fell broadly
on his terror-stricken face.</p>

<p>"It's Phil Yates!" exclaimed a score of voices.</p>

<p>The wretch had ceased to struggle; he felt that his doom
was sealed, and lay panting and passive in their clutches.</p>

<p>"This accounts for his good-nature," resounded on all
sides. "This explains the general treat. He meant to
stupefy us and then shirk the murder on some one."</p>

<p>"Where's Tom?" called one of the number.</p>

<p>A rush was made through the rooms, but the confederate
had escaped.</p>

<p>"At least we will serve this fellow out!" cried a hoarse
voice.</p>

<p>"Ay! ay!" they shouted, "down stairs with him! There's
a blasted pine back of the house&mdash;just the thing!"</p>

<p>They gathered about the shuddering man like wild beasts
scenting their prey. Hinchley in vain attempted to speak a
word which might gain the miserable man a reprieve. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
pushed him rudely aside, dragged their victim down the stairs
and out upon the veranda, the throng parting right and left,
allowing those who held him free passage.</p>

<p>In an instant the whole valley seemed aroused, and hundreds
of fierce faces glared on the hapless creature as he
hung powerless over the shoulders of his captors.</p>

<p>There was a hurried consultation among those nearest the
criminal; terrible words broke from their lips which were
echoed in husky whispers by the whole crowd.</p>

<p>"Hang him! hang him!"</p>

<p>Again the crowd parted, and four stalwart men dragged
the half insensible creature round a corner of the house and
moved toward a shivered pine-tree that stretched out its
blasted limbs between the dwelling and the precipice.</p>

<p>"We want a rope," some one said.</p>

<p>A man rushed out of the house, carrying a long crimson
scarf, which he fluttered over the heads of the crowd.</p>

<p>"This will do famously!" he called. "It belonged to his
wife&mdash;she was huddling it over her face."</p>

<p>"Where is the woman?" they yelled. "Let's exterminate
every snake in the nest!"</p>

<p>"She isn't on hand&mdash;twisted herself out of my hold like a
cat, dashed off to the precipice, and the last I saw of her she
was dragging herself up by the bushes."</p>

<p>"Dickinson is gone, too."</p>

<p>"No matter; we have this one safe. Gracious, how
limpsy he is!"</p>

<p>"Make short work of it, then, before he shows fight."</p>

<p>"Never fear!" shouted one of his captors. "Say a prayer,
you villain; it's your last chance."</p>

<p>The hapless wretch only moaned; fear had drawn him
beyond the power of speech. Closer gathered the crowd&mdash;he
felt their breath hot upon his cheek; hundreds of fierce eyes
glared into his own; innumerable voices roared out his death-sentence.
It was a terrible scene.</p>

<p>They seized the scarf and twisted it fiercely about his
neck; scores of ruthless hands forced him toward the skeleton
tree; the shouts and execrations grew more fiendish, and
over all the sinking moon shed her last pale luster, lighting
up that work of horror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The man had spoken truly. Sybil Yates had fled to the
hill. With the first cries of Hinchley, she had attempted to
escape from the principal entrance. But the valley was sprinkled
with camp-fires which must betray her. In front of the
house, lanterns swung from the knotted cedar-posts, and cast
their unsteady light on a crowd of fierce men swarming
toward the cries that still rung through the dwelling. One
of these men saw her, and, leaping up the stairs, tore the
scarf from her head, bringing a flood of hair down with it.
She wrenched herself from the grasp he fastened on her arm,
plunged down a back staircase, and, darting by the blasted
pine, made for the precipice.</p>

<p>The face of this rocky wall was torn apart near the base,
and the fissure, which slanted across the face of the precipice,
choked up with myrtle-bushes, grape-vines and trees, stinted
in their growth from want of soil; but it was deep enough to
hide that poor human creature flying for her life. She ran
toward the broken line which betrayed the fissure, and, crushing
through the sweet myrtle-bushes, fastened her foot in a
coil of vines, and crept upward with that scared face turned
over her shoulder, unable to tear her eyes from the crowd of
men that came sweeping round the house and surged up to
that gaunt pine-tree.</p>

<p>They carried lanterns, and torches of burning pine, throwing
a red light all around and illuminating the very foot of
the precipice. Sybil crowded herself back into the fissure
and dragged the vines over her. Then, shuddering till the
foliage trembled around her, she looked through it, ghastly
with fear but fascinated still. There was the man who had
been her fate, the cruel tyrant whose breath had made her
tremble an hour ago, lying across the shoulders of his late
friends, already half lifeless, yet shrieking faintly from dread
of the death to which they were lighting him.</p>

<p>The woman was seized with dizzy terror. The lights
flowed before her eyes in a river of fire. The specters of a
thousand gaunt old trees danced through it, and among them
swung a human form to and fro, to and fro, as it would sway
through her memory forever and ever. She was pressed
against the rock, her foot tangled in the coiling vines, her
hands clenched hard among the tender shrubs&mdash;but for that
she must have fallen headlong to the broken rocks beneath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>All at once the tumult ceased; a frightful stillness came
over that dark crowd; men shrunk away from its outskirts
into the darkness, frightened by their own demon work. She
clung to the vines, and looked down dizzily; a feeling of
horrible relief came over her. She turned her face to the
rock, and held her breath, listening, as if his voice could still
reach her.</p>

<p>It was near morning before the crowd around that tree
dispersed. Then she crept feebly down the rocky fissure, and
stood trembling on the trampled grass. One glance upon the
pine, and she turned away, sick at heart. A fragment of her
own red scarf fluttered there&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;</p>

<p>Shutting her eyes close, Sybil staggered on toward the
house, entered the back-door, and descended the cellar-stairs.
She took a lamp and some matches from a niche in the wall,
and passed on into the cellar. She had been there once
before within the last forty-eight hours, and every thing
necessary for her flight was prepared.</p>

<p>Connected with the cellars was a small natural cave, which
had been used as a place to keep liquor-casks. Sybil and
her husband alone knew of the real use to which this place
was put.</p>

<p>Only a few moments after, Sybil stood in that cave so
metamorphosed that she might have passed unquestioned,
even by her best friend.</p>

<p>She was attired in the dress of a Spanish sailor, her delicate
skin dyed of a rich, dark brown, her golden hair concealed
under a slouched hat, beneath which were visible short, thick
curls of raven hair.</p>

<p>There was still other work to be done. Carefully shading
her lamp from the draught of air, the woman moved toward
a corner of the vault, pulled away several heavy casks, which
it would have seemed beyond her power to lift, raised one of
the flat stones with which a portion of the vault had been
paved, and disclosed the lid of an iron chest.</p>

<p>She unlocked it, flung up the top lid, and the lamplight
struck upon a quantity of gold-dust and money which had
been concealed there.</p>

<p>Yates had collected that store without the knowledge of his
confederates; even Sybil had discovered his secret by accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" she muttered, impatiently, "there is a fortune here.
I can not carry it. No matter, it is safe&mdash;only let me escape
this spot. Some other time. It can not be found. Some
other time."</p>

<p>She took out as many pieces of gold as she could manage
to bestow about her person without encumbering her flight;
but even in her distress and danger, her judgment and reason
were capable of action. It was better to leave the money in
safety, and return for it at some future time, than to overload
herself so much that her flight would be impeded. She might
become so weary of the weight as to be forced to fling it aside.
Thus the woman reasoned only a few hours after that death
scene.</p>

<p>She closed the chest, locked it and replaced the stones,
piled the empty boxes in their former position, and crept
away. She extinguished the little lamp, flung it into a dark
corner of the cellar, and bent her steps toward the opening,
which was so overgrown with weeds that it was entirely
hidden.</p>

<p>She managed to raise herself along the broken wall, and
forced her way through the narrow aperture into the open
air. Her face and hands were bleeding from the wounds she
had received against the sharp stones, but she felt no pain.</p>

<p>She was completely hidden from the view of all those
about the house by a dense thicket of cactus and flowery
shrubs, which formed a thick wall for a considerable distance.
Her pony was tied to a tree where she had herself stationed
him early in the evening. For the first time a look of
exultation shot into her face&mdash;she was safe now!</p>

<p>Before mounting her horse, she crept along the edge of the
thicket to a spot from whence she could command a view of
the house.</p>

<p>The crowd was still rushing wildly about&mdash;she could hear
their murmurs and execrations. The moon had set, but the
cold dawn cast a gray light over the landscape.</p>

<p>Sybil turned her eyes toward the dwelling. She saw the
pine-tree&mdash;that one projecting branch from which a fragment
of the silk scarf fluttered yet.</p>

<p>After that momentary glance she started up, mounted her
pony, and rode rapidly away through the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>So the day broke, still and calm. The first glow of the
sun tinged the mountain tops, leaving the valley still in deep
shadow. The excited throngs moved restlessly about, and at
length group after group started away from the house, anxious
to escape the sickening sight which met their eyes; now that
their fury was satiated, they turned in dread away.</p>

<p>The sun mounted higher in the heavens, shot dazzlingly
against the sides of the mountains, colored the noisy torrent,
and played softly about the old house.</p>

<p>Not a living thing was in sight. The sun played over the
grass, rustled the vines, and there, in the silence and amid the
shadows, hung that still form, swayed slowly to and fro by
the light breeze that struck the branches.</p>

<p>An hour passed, but there was no change!</p>

<p>Afar through the forest rode the fearless woman, seeking a
place of shelter. The last fetter which had bound her to
that horrible life was severed. Across the dark sea she could
seek a new home, and make for herself another existence,
untroubled by a single echo from the past.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A CANTER AND A FALL.</p>


<p>It was a lofty, well-lighted apartment, fitted up with book-cases,
yet, from its general arrangement, evidently occupied
as much for a sitting-room as a library.</p>

<p>The easy-chairs were pushed into commodious corners, the
reading table, in the center of the floor, was covered with
newspapers and pamphlets; but they had been partially
moved aside to afford place to a tiny work-basket, an unstrung
guitar with a handful of flowers scattered over it, and various
other trifles&mdash;all giving token of a female presence and occupations,
which alone can lend to an apartment like this a
pleasant, home-like appearance.</p>

<p>It was near sunset; two of the windows of the library
looked toward the west, and a rich glow stole through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
parted curtains, from the mass of gorgeous clouds piling
themselves rapidly up against the horizon.</p>

<p>But at the further end of the room, the shadows lay heavy
and dark, and two statues gleamed out amid the gloom, like
ghosts frightened away from the sunlight.</p>

<p>In that dimness a woman walked slowly to and fro, her
hands linked loosely together, her dress rustling faintly against
the carpet, and her every movement betraying some deep and
engrossing thought.</p>

<p>For a full half-hour she had indulged in that revery, all the
while moving slowly up and down, the fixed resolution of her
face growing harder, and her eyes turned resolutely toward
the shadows, as if there was something in the cheerful radiance
at the other end of the room which caused her pain or
annoyance.</p>

<p>In that dim light, the countenance had an expression from
which one entering unperceived would have shrunk instinctively;
yet a portrait of the face, painted as it appeared
among the shadows, would hardly have been recognized by
those daily accustomed to a view of the features.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was the gloom around which gave the face that
look&mdash;cold, hard, unrelenting force&mdash;and lent the eyes that
subtle, dangerous gleam.</p>

<p>Some noise from without disturbed her reflections; she
dropped her arms to her side, and passed quietly toward the
middle of the room. As she stood for an instant by the table,
the rosy light of the approaching sunset played full upon her
face; it scarcely seemed possible it could be the one which
looked so dark and cruel among the shadows only a moment
before.</p>

<p>An erect, well-proportioned figure, rather below the medium
height, yet so graceful and elegant that at the first glance one
would have pronounced her tall. She was still quite young,
out of her teens possibly, but no one would have judged her
twenty-one&mdash;in the twilight her face had appeared ten years
older at least.</p>

<p>The features were finely cut, the lips a trifle too thin, perhaps,
but the complexion was wonderfully delicate; rich
masses of light brown hair, which in the sunlight took a
golden tinge, were brushed in wavy folds back from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
smooth, low forehead, underneath which the gray eyes looked
out as calm and cold as though deep emotion had never
brought shadows or tears into their depths.</p>

<p>It would have been a very acute observer that could have
read that pale, secretive face. One might have lived years in
daily intercourse with her, and never believed her any thing
but a quiet person, yielding herself good-naturedly to the plans
or amusements of others, and finding sufficient content therein.</p>

<p>While she stood by the table, the tramp of horses sounded
upon the gravel sweep without; she moved to the window,
and remained watching the groom as he led a couple of
saddle-horses up and down before the side-entrance of the
house.</p>

<p>Very soon there was a sound of opening doors, and a man's
voice called from the hall:</p>

<p>"Margaret! Miss Waring!"</p>

<p>The lady started at those clear, somewhat imperative tones,
but the summons was evidently not intended for her; after
that involuntary movement, she resumed her former attitude,
leaning against the window-sill with her eyes fixed absently
upon the changing sky.</p>

<p>In a moment the door of the library opened, and a gentleman
advanced a step or two beyond the threshold, looking
around as if in search of some one. When he saw the young
lady standing there, he said, hastily:</p>

<p>"I thought Margaret was here."</p>

<p>She turned as if for the first time conscious of his presence.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; what did you wish?"</p>

<p>"I am looking for Miss Waring; I heard George bring up
the horses several moments since."</p>

<p>"I believe she is in her room; shall I call her?"</p>

<p>"Pray do not trouble yourself, Miss Chase. I dare say she
will be down immediately."</p>

<p>"Here I am now," said a voice from the stairs, and a young
lady very pretty and <i>petite</i> entered the room dressed in a riding-habit.
"I hope I have not kept you waiting, Mr. Laurence."</p>

<p>"I am only just ready," he replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>Miss Chase half turned from the window; the sunset rays
fell upon her hair and forehead, and, partially shut in by the
folds of the curtains, she made an exceedingly striking picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret was buttoning her gauntlets, but Laurence caught
the effect, and was pleased, as any one with the slightest
artistic taste must have been.</p>

<p>"You have not put on your habit, Miss Chase," he said.
"Don't you ride with us?"</p>

<p>"I made my excuses to Miss Waring an hour ago," she
replied, in the sweet, calm voice habitual with her.</p>

<p>"She has a bad headache," said the young lady mentioned,
looking up from her task, "and is bent on a solitary walk in
hopes of curing it."</p>

<p>"I thought you were never troubled with such pretty little
female ailments," returned Laurence, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"It very seldom happens," answered Miss Chase, indifferently,
turning more toward the window, as if she did not wish
any conversation to deprive her of a view of the sunset.</p>

<p>"It seems a little selfish for us to leave you to a lonely
walk," he continued.</p>

<p>"So I told her," added Margaret; "but she would not be
persuaded."</p>

<p>"I would not prevent your ride for the world," she said, in
precisely the same unmoved tone. "I shall only walk to the
gates and back."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you can not accompany us," Laurence
said. "I suppose that wretched headache will prevent me
taking my revenge at chess to-night."</p>

<p>"Hardly, I think; it will go off in the cool of the evening."</p>

<p>"You are very obliging&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, she means to beat you unmercifully," interrupted
Margaret; "don't you, Miss Chase?"</p>

<p>"If I can, of course," she replied, with a little deprecatory
gesture, as if the attempt were likely to prove a hopeless one.</p>

<p>"We shall see," returned the gentleman. "Come, Margaret,
the horses will get restless. A pleasant walk, Miss Chase."</p>

<p>She bowed, and watched the pair out of the room; when
the door closed, she took her old station, saw them mount
and ride swiftly down the avenue.</p>

<p>Very quiet and still she stood there&mdash;there was no pulsation
strong enough even to stir the lace upon her bosom.
One hand fell at her side, the other was pressed hard against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the marble sill, and once more the cold, fixed resolution crept
slowly over her countenance.</p>

<p>It must have been a full half-hour before she in turn left
the apartment. She went up to her room, came down with
her bonnet and shawl on, and walked out upon the broad
veranda which ran the whole length of the house.</p>

<p>She did not follow the avenue which led from the dwelling
down to the highway, but took one of the numerous paths
which wound among the shrubberies. Sometimes in the full
glory of the waning sunset, anon a darker shadow among the
other shadows that lay under the trees, she passed, walking
rapidly, as if anxious to find quiet in bodily fatigue&mdash;then
forgetting her purpose, if it had been present to her mind,
and moving slowly along, deeply engrossed in thought as
when she stood in the library an hour before.</p>

<p>It was already twilight when Sybil Chase reached the ponderous
iron gates which gave entrance from the road to the grounds.
She seated herself upon a stone bench a little off from the
avenue, and gazed quietly around with that observing eye
which never lost the most minute particular.</p>

<p>The air was soft and warm, the moon was already coming
up and dispelling the dusky shadows sufficiently to distinguish
objects at a considerable distance. The murmur of a little
brook that traversed the grounds and came out of the thicket
back of her seat was pleasantly audible, and the deafened cry
of a whippowill sounded through the distance. The moon
rose higher, the repose of the spring evening increased, and
through the distance Sybil's quick ear detected the tramp of
horses, faint but rapidly approaching nearer.</p>

<p>She rose from the bench and looked up the road. She saw
Margaret and Mr. Laurence cantering gayly over the nearest
hill. While she looked, the girl's horse shied at some object
by the road&mdash;started so violently that his rider, evidently taken
by surprise, was thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>Sybil Chase pressed her two hands hard together, a quick
breath broke from her lips, and her eyes looked out large and
wild; but she made no effort to go forward&mdash;never stirred
from her attitude of strange expectancy.</p>

<p>Before Mr. Laurence could dismount and go to his companion's
assistance, a man rode rapidly up behind them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
Sybil saw him stop, spring from his horse, and hasten with
Mr. Laurence toward the lady. Before they reached the
spot, Margaret had risen; through the stillness Sybil caught
the echo of hurried exclamations, a gay laugh from the young
girl, which seemed to give assurance that she had suffered no
injury.</p>

<p>At that sound the lady whispered a few words to herself;
then, after an instant of hesitation, hurried toward the gates,
pushed them open, and ran with all her speed toward the foot
of the hill.</p>

<p>Before she reached the first rise, the three had mounted
and were riding toward her; she was plainly visible to them
in the moonlight, toiling rapidly up the ascent, and apparently
so overcome by agitation that nothing but a desire to be of
service preserved her strength.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" she called, wildly.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," Margaret answered, while Laurence
waved his riding-cap gayly in the air.</p>

<p>Sybil clasped her hands, as if in involuntary thanksgiving,
and sunk down upon the bank.</p>

<p>They rode toward her; as they reached the spot, she rose
and called again:</p>

<p>"You are not hurt, Miss Waring?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Not even frightened, I believe," added Laurence.</p>

<p>"I thought she was killed," exclaimed Sybil. "Oh, that
dreadful shying horse! Don't&mdash;don't ride him again, Margaret."</p>

<p>The party drew rein near her.</p>

<p>"He meant no harm, poor fellow," returned Margaret.</p>

<p>"He might have killed you, nevertheless," said Sybil, with
a sort of reproachful anxiety.</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, and appeared much alarmed; nevertheless,
she found time to steal a quick glance toward the stranger
who accompanied her friends. As her eyes fell upon him
she gave a slight start, and her face grew pale; but, with
a strong effort, she mastered the emotion, and turned indifferently
away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE GAME AT CHESS.</p>


<p>A few more words passed, then Margaret said:</p>

<p>"Miss Chase, let me present Mr. Hinchley to you."</p>

<p>The lady bowed slightly in return to the stranger's salutation,
looked keenly from under her long eyelashes, and turned
again toward Miss Waring, who, in spite of her assertions,
was greatly terrified and shaken, as Sybil plainly detected
through all her forced spirits.</p>

<p>"By the luckiest chance in the world, Hinchley rode up at
the very moment Margaret fell," said Laurence.</p>

<p>"I was very fortunate in being so opportune in my arrival,"
replied the young man.</p>

<p>"We have not even asked how you happened to get here
so unexpectedly," said Margaret.</p>

<p>"I saw Dr. Thorne in town this morning, and he told me
that Uncle Gerald had been quite ill again, so I took the late
train up&mdash;luckily, Smith, at the depot, had a horse to
lend me."</p>

<p>"Uncle Gerald is better," Margaret said.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear it; those attacks get so much worse
that I was quite alarmed."</p>

<p>"He seems very much shaken by this one," Laurence said;
"but the doctor thinks he will soon get better; the warm
weather is coming on, and that always agrees with him, you
know."</p>

<p>"You will stay a week or so, Ralph," Margaret said.</p>

<p>"As long as I can; it depends on my news from town."</p>

<p>"Miss Waring looks pale," interrupted Sybil, whose head
was still averted from Hinchley.</p>

<p>"Are you really hurt, Margaret?" asked Hinchley.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," she replied; but her voice trembled
a little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is frightened, of course," said Sybil; "who could
help it? I am sure she will not ride again this season."</p>

<p>"I think she is cured of such fears," returned Laurence.</p>

<p>"Oh yes," answered Margaret, hastily. "But let us ride
home; it is getting late, and uncle will want to see Ralph
before going to bed."</p>

<p>The three rode through the gates, which Miss Chase had
left open, while that lady followed at a little distance.</p>

<p>"We are leaving her all alone," said Margaret, in a low
voice, to Laurence.</p>

<p>"That is true; and it scarcely looks civil," he replied.
"Ride on to the house, Margaret, with Hinchley, and I will
walk with her."</p>

<p>"Very well," Margaret said, unable longer to conceal her
nervousness, and not sorry that she could have an opportunity
to recover herself before again enduring her betrothed husband's
somewhat impatient scrutiny.</p>

<p>The pair rode on; Mr. Laurence dismounted from his
horse, and stood in the avenue as Miss Chase approached.</p>

<p>"You look in this moonlight pale and melancholy as a
knight-errant," she said, playfully.</p>

<p>"I am waiting for you," he replied.</p>

<p>"Indeed, there was no necessity."</p>

<p>"Does that mean you prefer to walk alone?"</p>

<p>"I am not much given to incivility, you know; I did not
wish to detain you from your friends."</p>

<p>"Oh, they will take care of each other," he replied. "I
wonder you don't say something about him&mdash;you are less
susceptible than most young ladies. Hinchley is a great
favorite."</p>

<p>"Please do not slander my sex, Mr. Laurence, or we shall
quarrel at once."</p>

<p>"And you will conquer me, as you always do at chess!
But at all events, you can not be offended at my saying that
you are different from youthful females in general; almost
any other would have asked twenty questions in a breath about
the stranger."</p>

<p>"But Mr. Hinchley is hardly a stranger," she replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, that is true; but I believe you have never met him
before."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; but I have heard Miss Waring talk so much of her
favorite cousin, and Mr. Waring is always sounding his
praises."</p>

<p>"He is almost like a brother to Margaret; I wonder you
never saw him when you were here before."</p>

<p>"He was in Europe," replied Sybil, indifferently. "I am
sorry Margaret received that fright."</p>

<p>"I wish she had a little of your courage."</p>

<p>"I have been accustomed to ride from childhood&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And are the best horsewoman I ever saw."</p>

<p>"I ought to deny it, but shall not. At all events, I am
not in the least afraid of Robin Hood nor of Sir Charles here;"
as Sybil spoke, she offered the horse one of the roses she held
in her hand. "That is a treat which the baronet appreciates,"
she added. "He isn't often fed with roses."</p>

<p>"What a waste of sentiment," he replied, "to feed a horse
on what any man would covet."</p>

<p>"He is grateful for them, at all events."</p>

<p>"Perhaps his master would be more grateful still; you
have not tried him."</p>

<p>She laughed, selected a beautiful bud from the bunch, and
looked at it for a moment. When he reached forth his hand,
she drew back the flower with a gesture too pretty to be called
coquetry.</p>

<p>"No; Sir Charles shall have that, and Miss Waring will
like the rest."</p>

<p>He was a little annoyed; any man would have been treated
with this seeming indifference whether he cared for the
person or not.</p>

<p>"You are determined never to be friends with me," he
said.</p>

<p>"On the contrary, I have to thank you and everybody
here for a great deal of kindness."</p>

<p>"I am sure both Margaret and Mr. Waring feel much
obliged to you; her health is so delicate, that the house would
have been in hopeless disorder except for your attention, and
the old gentleman considers you perfection."</p>

<p>"It is very pleasant to be appreciated," she answered,
gayly. "At least, you ought to thank me; I kept Miss Waring
from dying of regret during your absence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Margaret would never die from any such feeling," he
replied, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I think where she loves, all her feelings are centered."</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Chase, romance fades rapidly during a long
engagement."</p>

<p>"So all engaged people tell me," she answered; "I shall
take warning from this experience of others. But we must
walk faster; Miss Waring will think us lost, unless Mr.
Hinchley is charming enough to make her forget our absence."</p>

<p>"I think Margaret does not care much for the society of
gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Not in general, I believe."</p>

<p>"Nor in any particular case, I should hope," he said,
quickly. "We quarrel a great deal, as you know, Miss Chase,
but I have never thought coquetry among her faults."</p>

<p>"Nor I."</p>

<p>"Hinchley is greatly admired by young ladies," pursued
Laurence; "but he seems to care very little about it."</p>

<p>"He is very handsome&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, you hardly looked at him."</p>

<p>"I was quoting Miss Waring&mdash;incorrectly, however."</p>

<p>"What did she say?"</p>

<p>"That he had a very noble face&mdash;something above mere
beauty."</p>

<p>"She was quite eloquent," he said, dryly.</p>

<p>"Oh no; but we were alone, and could not be silent."</p>

<p>"And so you talked of Ralph Hinchley?"</p>

<p>"Naturally enough, as he is her nearest relative. Are you
blaming Miss Waring or me?"</p>

<p>"Neither, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Mr. Hinchley is dependent upon his profession, I believe."</p>

<p>"Yes; I fancy he is not rich at all."</p>

<p>"There I can sympathize with him."</p>

<p>"Have you come to that?"</p>

<p>"Don't make me appear silly! If Margaret were here,
I should say something that you might construe into a
compliment."</p>

<p>"You have never paid me one&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I never do compliment people whom I respect; that may
account for it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>"But what would you have said?"</p>

<p>"That the men I have been in the habit of meeting since I
came here have made me difficult to please, so that quite young
gentlemen seldom strike me favorably."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is flattery&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It would have been to Miss Waring."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"A compliment to her taste in selecting you as a husband."</p>

<p>By that time they had reached the veranda, and as she
spoke the last words, Miss Chase ran up the steps, humming
a song, and entered the hall just as Margaret descended the
stairs, after having exchanged her habit for a dress more
suitable to the house.</p>

<p>"Are you better?" Sybil asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; but I was terribly frightened, though I would not
have Mr. Laurence know it for the world&mdash;my timidity annoys
him so much."</p>

<p>"He is coming," whispered Miss Chase.</p>

<p>"Please come and make the tea," said Margaret; "my
hands shake yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence joined them in the hall.</p>

<p>"Well, you are not frightened, now it is all over?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"No, not much; anyway, I am unhurt."</p>

<p>Miss Chase threw back the hood of her cloak, and accompanied
them into the library; a glance at the hall-glass had
convinced her that her appearance was picturesque. She
stood a second in the door, took off the pretty blue mantle
and laid it on a sofa; the breeze had given her a color,
and her hair an added wave, particularly becoming.</p>

<p>Margaret ensconced herself in an easy-chair near the fire,
which had been kindled to give an appearance of comfort to
the room, although the night was too warm to render it
necessary. Miss Chase seated herself by the tray, while
Laurence turned to Margaret:</p>

<p>"Where is Hinchley?"</p>

<p>"Gone up to see uncle; he will be down in a moment."</p>

<p>The gentleman entered as she spoke. Sybil Chase was
occupied, and did not look up. He gave her a quick glance,
started, and a perplexed look passed over his face as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
fancied that he had seen her before, and was trying to remember
where; then it faded, and he sat down near his cousin.</p>

<p>"Uncle has gone to bed," he said; "he looks very ill to-night."</p>

<p>"But he is better, I am sure he is," she replied, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I hope so," he answered; and, remarking her agitation,
changed the subject at once. "Have you been trouting,
Laurence?" he asked. "I remember your old passion."</p>

<p>"I was out the other day, but we will go again&mdash;an expedition
for the ladies. Are you fond of trout-fishing, Miss
Chase?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I must plead guilty to the weakness and cruelty."</p>

<p>"And you, Margaret?"</p>

<p>"I shall like to go; but I never have any success."</p>

<p>"And you think it wicked, I believe?" he replied, carelessly,
and with a little irony, such as was often apparent in
the conversations between the two lovers.</p>

<p>"No matter what I think," she replied, smiling pleasantly
enough, although displeased at his manner; "I will not force
my private convictions upon any of you."</p>

<p>"But you will have a cup of tea?" said Miss Chase.</p>

<p>Mr. Hinchley went to the table, and taking the cup from
Sybil, carried it to his cousin.</p>

<p>"Hester has treated us to marmalade," said Laurence,
laughing, as he approached the table.</p>

<p>"Which I am morally certain you will spill on the carpet&mdash;won't
he, Miss Waring?"</p>

<p>"Of course; do keep him at the table, for the sake of the
new carpet we both admire so much."</p>

<p>"Then the whole dish of marmalade will be in danger,"
said Laurence.</p>

<p>"Miss Chase will wisely move it," added Hinchley.</p>

<p>"I think I must," added Sybil, "but there, you shall have
a very large spoonful; it is better than roses."</p>

<p>She put the conserve upon his plate, took up her flowers
that lay on the table, and added:</p>

<p>"I picked these for you, Miss Waring; they are from your
favorite bush."</p>

<p>She gave them to Hinchley to carry to Margaret; Mr.
Laurence ate his marmalade and looked a little vexed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"They are beautiful roses," Hinchley said.</p>

<p>"Very," Margaret replied, putting them carelessly in
her hair; "you shall have a bud to reward you for not having
purloined the whole bunch."</p>

<p>She selected a half-open rose and handed it to him. Miss
Chase smiled imperceptibly.</p>

<p>"May I have a cup of tea, Miss Chase?" asked Laurence,
adding, as he bent toward her: "You were over fastidious,
you see."</p>

<p>Not a word answered Sybil&mdash;just the slightest elevation
of her eyebrows, the least possible expression of surprise
about her mouth; yet, by that mere nothing, she contrived
to show that she disapproved of the innocent and thoughtless
act, but meant to keep any such feeling to herself.</p>

<p>The evening passed pleasantly enough. Mr. Laurence
forgot his momentary vexation, the cause of which he
could scarcely have told. He challenged Miss Chase to a
game of chess, and she consented.</p>

<p>While the two played, Margaret and Mr. Hinchley sat
by the fire, and talked of their uncle, the pleasures of old
times, new books, and the thousand other trifles, about
which people who have no deep feelings in common converse
together.</p>

<p>Miss Chase lost the game, because she had made up her
mind to be defeated; but the next she won. Still, during
the whole evening her attention was not sufficiently fixed
upon either board or moves to prevent her hearing and
seeing every thing that passed around her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE FEMALE IAGO.</p>


<p>The engagement between Laurence and Margaret Waring
had been a family affair, brought about principally by the
romance of a maiden aunt, with whom the young man was a
favorite.</p>

<p>Edward had been under this relative's charge after the
death of his parents, which occurred during his childhood,
and she had petted and spoiled the boy as only a spinster
could have done.</p>

<p>Mr. Waring, the uncle of Margaret, was one of Miss
Laurence's nearest neighbors, and the girl had been almost as
great a favorite with the spinster as her own nephew. Indeed,
it was said that Mabel Laurence had loved Margaret's father
in her youthful days; but how that might be nobody really
knew, for the old maid wisely kept her own secrets, as women,
after all, are apt to do when there is nothing to gratify the
vanity in them.</p>

<p>But it happened that the boy and girl were reared almost
like brother and sister, and the two houses were almost equally
homes to both. Mr. Waring was a confirmed invalid, whose
life seemed to hang upon a thread, and Miss Laurence had
always been in yearly expectation that the girl would soon
come entirely under her charge.</p>

<p>People are generally mistaken in such calculations, and Miss
Laurence was no exception; for when Margaret Waring was
sixteen, the spinster died in her arms after a short but violent
illness.</p>

<p>Edward, then a youth of twenty, was traveling in Europe,
and by one of the old lady's last commands was to remain
there at least a year longer. When the will was opened, it
was found to contain a singular clause&mdash;one common enough
in novels, and as the spinster had been an insatiable devourer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
of light literature, it is quite probable that she derived from
thence the idea which was expressed in her testament.</p>

<p>Her fortune, which was a very large one, was divided
equally between her nephew and Margaret Waring, on condition
that they became husband and wife; otherwise, no
provision was made for Margaret, a small annuity was left
Laurence, and the rest of the property was to be employed in
founding a hospital for old maids.</p>

<p>Now, I am not drawing upon my imagination for these
details; this was the will as it was actually written. Miss
Laurence was convinced that Margaret and her nephew
had loved each other from childhood, so that she believed
herself acting for their happiness; besides, she had English
blood in her veins, and could not resist the true British desire
to display her own power and authority, even after death.</p>

<p>The year passed. Edward Laurence returned home when
Margaret was seventeen; the engagement had been regarded
as a settled thing. The young people loved each other&mdash;there
could be no doubt of that; but, after a time, the very certainty
that their destinies had been settled for them in a
fashion so compulsory, led to all manner of disagreements and
quarrels.</p>

<p>Two years before the commencement of this record, Mr.
Waring had been obliged to go South for his health, and it
was necessary to provide a companion for Margaret during
his absence. Some friend had introduced Sybil Chase, and
she spent the winter in the family. From the time of her
entrance into that house could be dated the first real unhappiness
of the young pair.</p>

<p>Sybil had been brought up by a bad, unprincipled mother,
educated far beyond what the woman's means seemed to
permit, and for what end only her own erratic mind ever
knew. Soon after she left school, the young girl quarreled
with her mother, and for several years earned her own living
as best she might. We will not inquire too closely into the
records of that Bohemian life. It is sufficient for our story
that she at length took up her residence with Margaret
Waring, just as that young lady's engagement to young
Laurence became known.</p>

<p>How it came about, Margaret could never have told; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
before she had been many weeks in the house, Sybil Chase
had made herself of the utmost importance there. She quietly
relieved Margaret of every duty; she read to her, she talked
with her&mdash;not at all with the manner of a dependent, which,
in a certain sense, she was not, but as an equal and friend.</p>

<p>When Margaret had time to think, she felt a certain
unaccountable repugnance to Sybil; yet in her society there
was a charm which few people could have resisted. Against
her better judgment, contrary to her principles and her common
sense, Margaret acquired a habit of talking freely with
her. Sybil knew all the disagreements and troubles which
disturbed the house, understood perfectly Margaret's character,
and had studied Laurence himself with still more subtle
criticism.</p>

<p>With all the wild fervor of her passionate youth, Sybil Chase
became fatally attached to young Laurence; yet so firm was
her self-command, so deep her powers of duplicity, that she
gave no sign of the passion that consumed her. In the depths
of her soul she was resolved that the man she loved should
never fulfill his engagement; but just as she was beginning to
weave her meshes around him, Mr. Waring came home, broke
up his establishment, and proceeded with his daughter on a
long tour through the West Indies and Southern States.</p>

<p>Once more this singular young creature was thrown back
upon her mother's support. An imperfect reconciliation took
place between them, and she sunk gradually into her old life,
which became more and more irksome from contact with
persons so unlike those with whom she had been recently
associated.</p>

<p>While her mind was in this restless state, she heard that
young Laurence had followed his betrothed to Cuba, in which
place the marriage had taken place. The news stung her to
madness. In the first paroxysm of wounded affection and
mortified pride, she fell in with Philip Yates, married him
privately, and went away.</p>

<p>In two years she came back to her mother again, but to be
the protector, not the dependent, now. She had money, which
was shared generously with the old woman; but, in a short
time, this constant companionship with an unrefined and evil-minded
woman became unendurable. Sybil was in no state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of mind to accept the dull life presented in this companionship.
She had rested long enough, and now felt that keen hunger
for excitement which follows prolonged inaction.</p>

<p>While this fever was strong upon her, she met Laurence in
the street. Little suspecting the passion that drove the blood
from her cheek, or that they had met before in far distant
mountains of the golden State, he upbraided her kindly for
keeping aloof from her old friends, spoke regretfully of Mr.
Waring's still infirm health, and of Margaret's protracted
feebleness.</p>

<p>She choked down the passion that swelled in her throat,
and inquired kindly if his wife had been seriously ill.</p>

<p>Laurence laughed. "Wife?" he answered, coloring a little.
"Oh, Maggie and I are not married yet. The old gentleman
says that we are young enough to wait."</p>

<p>Sybil's heart bounded in her bosom. Her eyes flashed&mdash;she
could not altogether conceal the triumph of her joy.</p>

<p>"Are you never coming to see Margaret?" he said.</p>

<p>"Margaret&mdash;Margaret Waring? Oh yes."</p>

<p>"The old gentleman is seriously ill again. You ought to
come. He often says no one ever proved so good a nurse as
you."</p>

<p>"The good old man. I will go to him."</p>

<p>She went to Waring's house the next day, and stayed there.
Mr. Waring was ill and selfish; he would not let her go away.
She yielded with apparent reluctance, and quietly commenced
her work. By her soft words, broken sentences, and subtle
looks, Margaret and Laurence had become almost completely
estranged, and nothing but the persuasions of mutual friends
prevented their breaking the engagement which bound them.
Sybil looked on and waited, fostered their difficulties, and
watched for the moment which should secure the victory to
her love.</p>

<p>She was greatly aided by the manner in which their
betrothal had been brought about, the consequences of which
had been exactly those a wise person would have anticipated.
The romance of an involuntary engagement wore rapidly
away. Both were pained, and each blamed the other for
things which were at once the fault and the misfortune of a
forced position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret was proud and exacting, morbidly sensitive, and
her high spirit revolted at the idea of submission, often prevented
her yielding to her lover's wishes when she knew
herself to be in the wrong. These feelings rendered her fearful
of betraying her fondness, and in numberless ways brought
pain to her own heart and that of the man who loved her.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Edward was as passionate and imperious
as she could possibly be; his temper was violent, and when
that was roused, he gave way to every reckless word that
anger could suggest, forgetting them entirely when his temper
cooled. Margaret could not forget; she remembered them
all, treasured up every cruel word, every scornful sneer, like
poisoned arrows wherewith to pierce her heart anew in her
lonely hours.</p>

<p>The young girl grew cold and unsympathetic, careless of exciting
his rage, but often taking refuge in an icy impassibility, which
excited him more than any recrimination would have done.
A stubborn, obstinate will developed itself in her character,
against which the waves of her lover's passions beat in vain;
but that very resolution separated them still further.</p>

<p>All this had been the growth of Sybil's subtle influence.
For the first period of their engagement they had been very
happy. What caused their first quarrel, neither could have
told; the source was probably as slight as it usually is in such
cases; the effect had been fraught with many evil influences,
such as are apt to follow similar misunderstandings.</p>

<p>They had reached a point where each looked back on the
past with angry, defiant feelings. It was like gazing across a
troubled sea upon a fair landscape&mdash;to glance from the present
back into the beautiful past.</p>

<p>Had they been older and wiser, both parties might have
done much toward changing the state of things. A single
honest effort would have swept aside the heavy clouds which
loomed darkly in the future. But neither of them understood
this, or would have made any effort of the kind had it been
pointed out. So they quarreled openly and avowedly, and
the fact that in each heart lay a great well-spring of affection,
made their quarrels more bitter and implacable.</p>

<p>Margaret was made to believe that her lover had ceased to
care for her, and wished to continue his engagement only that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
he might tyrannize and command. Her health had become
more delicate than ever, the bloom of early girlhood was
fading, and although still very lovely, she had learned to think
her beauty gone, and decided that with it all affection had departed
from the heart of her betrothed. Those feelings and suspicions
made her colder and more unyielding, until Edward
wondered he could ever have thought her winning or gentle.
He was irritated by the indifference with which she treated
every attempt at a reconciliation, and the violence of his
temper increased in proportion to the pain of his position.</p>

<p>They suffered greatly, those poor, blind creatures! Daily
the cloud which had descended upon their home grew blacker
and swept them still further apart. Indeed, they had reached
that point where it would need but a little thing to bring the
tempest down in its wild fury&mdash;the terrible tempest which
should wrench from them all hope of happiness or peace, which
must desolate their after lives, and leave them stranded upon
a desert with no hope left, no memory unstained, no love in
the future.</p>

<p>The marriage of this young couple had been deferred from
various causes, the principal ones being Mr. Waring's frequent
illnesses and the delicate state in which Margaret's health had
fallen during the past year.</p>

<p>Laurence almost made his home at the house, and as he
had no profession or settled business, he found more time
than was requisite for making himself miserable, and gave
way to all manner of repinings.</p>

<p>During her former residence at Mr. Waring's house, it had
chanced that Hinchley had never seen Sybil Chase, and her
very existence was almost unknown to him, before that agitated
introduction on the hill-side. Thus she had no fears of
a recognition, or that her face would bring back to him that
fearful night in the valley ranche. With her heart thus at
rest, she went down stairs on the morning after his arrival,
according to her usual habit since the pleasant June weather
had come in. No members of the family were stirring
except the servants, for Margaret was inclined to gratify the
indolence arising from ill-health, and the family breakfast-hour
was always a late one.</p>

<p>With her cheeks fresh as the roses, Miss Chase descended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the stairs, went forth to the garden, and proceeded into the
rose thickets, looking beautiful and bright as the dewy scene
that surrounded her. Indeed, as she stood there in her gipsy
bonnet and muslin dress, a prettier picture could not well be
imagined.</p>

<p>She had a basket on her arm, a pair of scissors in her
hand, and daintily snipped off the stems of such blossoms as
pleased her; she pressed the gathered roses to her red lips till
they were wet with dew, took the fresh scent of each in turn,
and dropped one after another into her basket. While pursuing
her task, she sung snatches of pleasant tunes in a clear
soprano voice that floated richly on the air.</p>

<p>Occasionally, in the midst of her employment, Miss Chase
glanced toward the upper windows or the hall-door. The
first person who appeared was Mr. Laurence. He saw Sybil
and walked toward her. Miss Chase was greatly occupied
just then, and gave no attention to his approach.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he said; "are you talking so sweetly
with those roses that you can neither see nor hear?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to steal their color," she replied, with an
honest sort of frankness that was very captivating. "Look
at this bud, Mr. Laurence; did you ever see any thing more
beautiful?"</p>

<p>"Lovely, indeed; you perceive you were over fastidious
about giving away your flowers last night. Margaret did not
prize them as highly as you expected."</p>

<p>"What proof have you?"</p>

<p>"She gave one to Hinchley."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, so she did; but he is a relative, remember. I
need not offer you flowers in your own garden. I am certain
it was the merest thoughtlessness which made Margaret bestow
the roses on your guest last night."</p>

<p>"Who ever supposed it was any thing else?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought&mdash;that is, from the way you spoke&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What did you think?"</p>

<p>"That you were not pleased, if I must say it."</p>

<p>"I thought very little about the matter. I have no fancy
for setting up as a pale-faced Othello."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, I should hope not; there would be nobody but
me to play Emilie, and I should certainly run away, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
of standing by poor Desdemona. But I have to beg your
pardon for my absurd mistake."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"For thinking you were displeased. I might have known
you had more sense, but I have seen men who would have
pouted for a week over a trifle of less consequence."</p>

<p>"Did you think it wrong?"</p>

<p>"Good heavens, no; but I am not a proper judge. I suppose
every wife ought to be exceedingly careful; but then,
is a woman to be deprived of every bit of sentiment or
romance?"</p>

<p>"I don't think Margaret addicted to either. I should be
sorry to believe it."</p>

<p>"And I too. But I must take my basket of flowers into
the house; don't stand here fighting shadows, Mr. Laurence."</p>

<p>"I am not aware that I have been doing battle with any
such unsubstantial thing," he answered.</p>

<p>Miss Chase turned toward the house; he followed, but with
a new train of thought awakened in his mind. He began to
wonder if he really had been displeased at this trifle; certainly,
he was not jealous, but he would permit no impropriety.
Had there been any? The simple giving of a flower&mdash;she
had done nothing more than that; and yet&mdash;well, he
had not thought much of it at the time, but Miss Chase had
in a measure convinced him that he was more impressed than
he had believed. If Margaret was going to add coquetry to
her numerous other faults, his life would be irksome enough!</p>

<p>He accompanied Sybil into the breakfast-room, helped her
arrange the flowers, and in the process they fell into a pleasant
conversation. It was a full half-hour before Hinchley or
Margaret made their appearance. A great deal can be done
in that length of time, especially when economized with as
much wisdom as Sybil Chase was capable of employing.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTHER AND DAUGHTER.</p>


<p>Soon after breakfast, Hinchley and Laurence rode over to
a neighboring town upon some business for Mr. Waring,
leaving the two ladies alone.</p>

<p>Miss Chase and Margaret still sat in the breakfast-room,
the latter pretending to read the paper, from very weariness
and disinclination to talk, while Sybil held some embroidery
in her hand, and, under cover of that employment, watched
her companion with keen scrutiny.</p>

<p>"I am seized with a fever," she said, suddenly.</p>

<p>Margaret looked up and smiled a little.</p>

<p>"What is the name of it," she asked.</p>

<p>"One common enough to us poor, weak women&mdash;I want
a new spring dress. If it were not for leaving you alone, I
am half inclined to run into town and make a purchase."</p>

<p>"Do not let me detain you," returned Margaret, feeling so
ill at ease with herself and every thing and person around
her, that she was pleased with this prospect of solitude.</p>

<p>"I suppose the gentlemen will soon return."</p>

<p>"I am sure I do not know," she answered, indifferently.</p>

<p>"You will not feel lonely if I go?"</p>

<p>"Pray, do not think me so foolish."</p>

<p>"You know I like to sit with you, Miss Waring."</p>

<p>"But to-day, go to town and shop if the mania has taken
possession of you. By the way, if you see any pretty pink
organdy, you may purchase it for me, and leave it at Mrs.
Forrest's to be made up. I remember now, a new dress is
the very thing I want."</p>

<p>"I had better dress at once; let me see: the train starts at
eleven. I shall be in town at two o'clock."</p>

<p>"George will drive you over to the depot; you have just
time to dress and get there. You will be back to dinner?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh yes; before, perhaps."</p>

<p>After a few careless words, Miss Chase went up to her
room, and as she passed down stairs ready to go, opened the
door of the breakfast-room, where Margaret sat in the same
dreary solitude.</p>

<p>"Have you any other commands?" she asked, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"None, thank you; what a fine day you will have."</p>

<p>"Oh, lovely; good-morning."</p>

<p>Margaret returned this farewell, and Miss Chase took her
departure.</p>

<p>There the unhappy girl remained, and let the hours float
on while she gave herself up to a thousand bitter reflections.
The bright spring morning had no charm for Margaret, the
merry carols of the birds upon the lawn had lost their sweetness
to her ear; she could only gaze upon the dark shadows
of her life, and mark how, day by day, it drifted into deeper
gloom. Her strength seemed to fail daily, and that of itself
would have been sorrow enough for one of her age; but she
had sterner troubles still.</p>

<p>How the promise of her girlhood had cheated her! The
affection which she had believed was to brighten all coming
years, was rapidly fading from her life.</p>

<p>Let it go! She would make no effort to recover either the
hopes or the love that she had lost. Laurence might take his
own course; she would not try to recall his wandering fancies.
She believed that her heart was strong enough to despise his
love if again offered. There Margaret made the mistake
which all young persons fall into when the proud, untried
heart falls into its first love-sorrow.</p>

<p>While Margaret indulged in that mournful revery, Sybil
Chase was on her way to the city, smiling and pleasant,
affable to every one that came in her way; even the servant,
who drove her over to the station, thought to himself what a
different lady she was from his silent, haughty mistress; and
the farmers who rented portions of Mr. Waring's estate, and
among whom she had made herself a very popular person,
smiled pleasantly as she rode by.</p>

<p>Cheerful and handsome she looked, sitting in the train, and
being whirled rapidly along the pretty route on her way to
town. She reached the city even earlier than she anticipated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and went about her errands at once, with her accustomed
straightforwardness. Nothing was forgotten. Margaret's indifferent
message was punctually fulfilled, and in a manner
which must have satisfied a much more difficult person than
Margaret.</p>

<p>When she had completed her purchases, Miss Chase took
her way to a retired and somewhat unpleasant part of the
town. She had her vail drawn, and hurried along as if
anxious not to be observed by any chance acquaintance.</p>

<p>She stopped before a decent looking tenement-house, ascended
the steps, glanced about with her habitual caution, to
see that no one was watching her, and entered the hall. She
mounted the weary staircase, which appeared interminable,
passed through several dark entries, and at length knocked
at one of the doors which opened into a passage nearest the
roof.</p>

<p>Twice she knocked, the second time imperatively and with
impatience; then a querulous voice called out:</p>

<p>"Come in, can't you; the door isn't locked."</p>

<p>So Miss Chase turned the knob, opened the door, and entered
a small, plainly furnished room, yet bearing no evidence
of the extreme poverty which often makes the tenement-house
so dreary.</p>

<p>A woman was seated near the little window, in a stiff-backed
chair, dividing her attention between a half-finished
stocking and a number of some weekly newspaper of the
cheapest class, full of wonderful cuts and more wonderful
stories.</p>

<p>She looked up quickly as Miss Chase entered, gave out an
evil, wicked glance, which appeared natural to her, although
the general appearance of her face was quiet and commonplace
enough.</p>

<p>"So you've come," was her only salutation.</p>

<p>"Yes; did you expect me?"</p>

<p>"I expected you three days ago."</p>

<p>"I was constantly occupied; it was impossible for me to
get away until now."</p>

<p>"You needn't lie," returned the woman, curtly.</p>

<p>"I won't," said Sybil, serene as ever.</p>

<p>She seated herself opposite the female and untied her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
bonnet-strings, looking placid and at home, as she invariably
was in all places and under all circumstances.</p>

<p>The woman glanced keenly at her, and a strange sort of
affectionate look crept over her face.</p>

<p>"You're brooding mischief," she pronounced suddenly and
emphatically, as if she would permit no contradiction.</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?" Sybil asked.</p>

<p>"'Cause you grow good-looking; when you get that bright,
contented look, I always know there's something in the
wind."</p>

<p>"You are very wise," replied Sybil, evincing no displeasure
at the accusation, which would have struck many persons
unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I ain't blind; I've generally kept my eyes open
going through this world."</p>

<p>"That is the only way, if one does not wish to run against
the wall."</p>

<p>"As you did once," retorted the woman, with a chuckle;
"you know you did that, cute as you think yourself."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten it," replied Sybil, coolly; "the hurt
taught me to keep my eyes open too."</p>

<p>"Learned you to look before you leap," said the woman.
"Well, I guess you owe a good deal to my lessons."</p>

<p>Sybil did not answer, but shrugged her shoulders slightly,
and gazed out of the window, occupied with her own
reflections.</p>

<p>"Now don't act as if I was a log of wood," said the woman,
fretfully; "there's nothing makes me so mad."</p>

<p>"I was waiting to hear what you would say next."</p>

<p>"What did you come for?"</p>

<p>"To see you, of course."</p>

<p>"Well, look at me; I don't charge any thing for the sight!
I used to be worth the trouble of turning round to see, I did;
I was better looking than you are or ever will be&mdash;but that's
all over. Just say what you're after now."</p>

<p>"I came because I thought you wanted something."</p>

<p>"You should have brought me money three days ago; I
hate to be behindhand with my rent."</p>

<p>"Surely you ought to have had enough for that; you
know how little money I possess...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fiddle-de-dee! Ask that Laurence for some."</p>

<p>"I can not do that; you must see how impossible it is."</p>

<p>"There's nothing impossible where money is concerned.
But no matter, take your own way."</p>

<p>"It is growing clear now," said Sybil.</p>

<p>"Time it did; you've made mistakes enough."</p>

<p>Sybil did not appear desirous of pursuing the conversation.
She took out her purse, counted several gold pieces into her
palm, while the woman watched her with covetous eyes.</p>

<p>"That will serve you until I come again," she said, extending
her hand.</p>

<p>The woman clutched the money eagerly, counted it twice
to be certain there was no mistake, then rose from her seat
and went to an old bureau in a corner of the room. After
fumbling in her pocket for a while, and pulling out a heterogeneous
mass of things, a dingy red silk handkerchief among
the rest, she produced a small key, unlocked one of the
drawers, and put the gold carefully away in a buckskin bag;
then she locked the bureau again, and returned to her seat.</p>

<p>"That is safe," she said, more complacently; the touch of
the money had evidently mollified her feelings. "Now, let's
talk about something else&mdash;about your plans, say."</p>

<p>"I can not answer your questions; every thing is dark
yet&mdash;a few months will decide."</p>

<p>"Don't you get careless, you know."</p>

<p>"There is no fear; I am not a child."</p>

<p>"No; and you've learned by the hardest."</p>

<p>"Don't ever speak of the past; I can bury it now&mdash;I have
buried it."</p>

<p>"Wal, it's a dead friend I guess you ain't sorry to be
rid of."</p>

<p>Sybil looked white; her eyes had a strained, unnatural
expression, and her hands clenched together with the old
force and tightness.</p>

<p>"It is all over&mdash;all over."</p>

<p>"Nothing to be afraid of, I s'pose, unless you believe in
ghosts or such things."</p>

<p>Sybil's face changed; she dropped her hands; the color
came back to her cheek&mdash;she laughed outright, a defiant,
mocking sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not at all; no ghost will trouble me&mdash;not even <i>his</i>."</p>

<p>"Tell me a little how things go on."</p>

<p>The woman drew closer to her visitor, and inclined her
head to listen attentively. Sybil talked for many moments in
a voice sunk almost to a whisper, as if dropping hints to
which she dared not give utterance aloud.</p>

<p>Her companion noted every word and movement, while a
bad, malignant expression crept over her face, till it seemed
impossible that it should ever have looked comely or pleasant.
Sometimes she nodded her head approvingly; once she laughed
outright. Sybil put up her hand to check the merriment,
which would have grated harshly upon a less well-attuned ear
than hers.</p>

<p>"I must go now," Miss Chase said, at last; "I shall not
get back by dinner-time as it is."</p>

<p>"I ought to be there," the woman exclaimed; "there is so
much I could do."</p>

<p>"I know that, if you would only manage to control your
temper."</p>

<p>"Never you fear me; I can do that easy enough when
there is any thing to be gained by it."</p>

<p>"One never knows what may happen. Always keep
yourself in readiness to obey my summons."</p>

<p>"I could start at any moment."</p>

<p>"We shall be obliged to wait; an opportunity may arise
by which I could introduce you to the house."</p>

<p>"Make the opportunity; a smart woman can always do
that."</p>

<p>"Ah! you have not my prudence."</p>

<p>"I guess you learned it lately; but we won't quarrel. If
you want me, I will come."</p>

<p>"You would not care in what way; you would not mind
the occupation?"</p>

<p>"Lord bless you, no; I'm good at any thing&mdash;general
housework, cooking; it's all fish that comes to my basket."</p>

<p>"Good-by, now," said Sybil; "I shall miss the train if I
stop another moment."</p>

<p>The woman followed her to the door, whispered some
added parting advice, and watched her disappear down the
stairs. Then she returned to the room and set about preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
herself a cup of tea, chuckling occasionally in a sharp way,
like a meditative macaw, and looking altogether so unpleasant
that a timid person would have been reluctant to remain alone
in the chamber with her.</p>

<p>As Miss Chase predicted, dinner was over when she reached
Mr. Waring's residence. She quietly disposed of her own
repast which the housekeeper had condescended to set aside for
her, and then, after changing her dress, went down into the
library.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence was sitting there alone, looking sullen and
discontented enough; but he brightened somewhat when she
entered, and greeted her cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I am glad you have come; I began to think I should
have to spend the evening by myself, as Hinchley is busy
with his uncle."</p>

<p>"Where is Miss Waring?" Sybil asked.</p>

<p>"In her own room, pouting or crying, according to the
stage her ill-humor has reached."</p>

<p>Sybil sighed and shook her head.</p>

<p>"Are you blaming me?" he asked. "It was not my fault
that we quarreled, but Margaret would provoke a saint! I
could not tell to save my life, what the disturbance began
about. I think I said one could not breathe in this room
for the flowers; with that she worked herself into a violent
rage, as if I had committed some unpardonable enormity."</p>

<p>"You should be patient," said Miss Chase.</p>

<p>"I know my temper is bad, but she seems to do every
thing in her power to excite it. Why should you always
blame me?"</p>

<p>"Am I blaming you?" she asked, softly. "It is not my
place to express any opinion upon your differences with Miss
Waring."</p>

<p>"I don't see why; both Margaret and myself regard you
as a friend. I know she tells you all her troubles freely
enough; why should you refuse to listen to my part of the
story?"</p>

<p>"I do not refuse," she answered, sighing heavily; "but it
pains me to know that you disagree so terribly."</p>

<p>"Disagree is a mild word; I admire your politeness; you
know we quarrel like two hawks in a cage."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Chase sighed again. This deep breath expressed as
much sympathy as words could have done, and was far
safer just there.</p>

<p>"The truth is," exclaimed Laurence, suddenly, "Margaret
does not love me; there is the foundation of our troubles."</p>

<p>"Are you not judging hastily?"</p>

<p>"No; I have felt it for a long time; I am certain of it
now. Tell me: do you believe any woman who loved a man
would act as she does? Do you consider that she conducts
herself as an engaged person should?"</p>

<p>"You must not ask me such questions; it would be wrong
in me to answer."</p>

<p>"At least you can say if you think she loves me?"</p>

<p>Miss Chase hesitated.</p>

<p>"Speak the truth," said he, violently.</p>

<p>"No," returned Sybil, in a low whisper.</p>

<p>"Every one sees it," continued Lawrence; "I knew you
did. She is hard-hearted and ungrateful."</p>

<p>"Do not be harsh&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How can I help it," he interrupted; "she has wrecked
my life&mdash;turned it into a curse. I have no hope&mdash;not a
friend."</p>

<p>A tear fell from Sybil's downcast lashes, and rolled slowly
down her cheek; she stole one glance, full of beautiful sympathy
toward him&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>"I believe you pity me," he said; "of late I have begun
to hope it. You will be my friend; say, will you not try to
help me?"</p>

<p>"So far as it is in my power, heaven knows I will. But
I am a woman; I must be so cautious. Indeed, I would not
incur Margaret's displeasure or that of Mr. Waring for the
world."</p>

<p>"She would hate any one who feels kindly toward me!"
He broke off abruptly, and gave himself up to a gloomy train
of thought which took him far away from his companion; it
did not suit Sybil to have it continue.</p>

<p>"You have had no tea," she said; "shall I order it
brought up?"</p>

<p>"If you will stay and take it with me."</p>

<p>"First, let me inquire if Miss Waring will come down."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Leave her where she is; I have had contention enough."</p>

<p>But Miss Chase kept her worldly wisdom in view. She
went up stairs and found Margaret lying on the bed, but the
unhappy girl could not be induced to rise.</p>

<p>"I don't wish any tea," she said; "I am going to sleep."</p>

<p>"Then I will have mine in my room."</p>

<p>"Please go down," said Margaret; "some of those tiresome
people from the village will be certain to call, and if you are
not ready to receive them, I shall be dragged out. I shan't
take the trouble for Ralph or Mr. Laurence."</p>

<p>Willing to oblige, Miss Chase consented, and returned to
the angry lover, only to exasperate his discontent.</p>

<p>No one did call that evening. Hinchley did not appear,
and the two spent it in sad, earnest conversation. Edward
Laurence retired to his room more than ever offended with
Margaret, and convinced that Sybil Chase was the only person
in the world who understood or pitied him&mdash;a high-minded,
clear-sighted woman, whom he respected, and whose
friendship appeared better worth having than the deepest love
of ordinary women. Sybil sat pondering over the fire. In
all the mischief which she had wrought, there was no possibility
of tracing her influence; she had told no bungling
falsehoods to be covered up or explained away; had committed
no little feminine indiscretions at which the mistress of a household
could cavil. Indeed, nothing could be more quiet and
respectable than her whole conduct. She was very kind and
useful in every respect. She made the house far more comfortable
than it had ever been before, and was always ready to
mediate in a quiet way between the lovers in their quarrels,
regretting, in a Christian manner, her inability to check
them altogether; but with all her precautions, she had a
difficult part to act, and it caused her much anxiety.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">HIGHCLIFF.</p>


<p>Of course that last quarrel between Laurence and Margaret
was put aside after a time, as so many previous difficulties had
been; but it left a more hurtful impression upon the minds
of both than any former disagreement had ever been able to
produce.</p>

<p>A party of guests, invited several months before, were staying
at the house for a week, and in the general gayety, both
Laurence and Margaret almost forgot their troubles. There
was nothing approaching confidence between them; they were
civil and polite, but avoided explanations. In the haughty
sensitiveness of young hearts, neither party was in a mood
for taking the first step toward a reconciliation.</p>

<p>Parties and expeditions of all sorts were planned and carried
out, into which Margaret entered with a feverish excitement
which increased her lover's anger; he could not understand
that her gayety was a vexed foam, rising and frothing
over the deep wretchedness within.</p>

<p>Ralph Hinchley was still at the house, and his quick perceptions
made him understand, more clearly than any one
else, the state of feeling between the unhappy pair.</p>

<p>He was an honorable, high principled man, and not for the
world would he have been guilty of an act which could produce
new discord with those already divided hearts. But he
pitied Laurence, and his sympathy for Margaret made him
unusually kind and gentle. But Miss Chase watched every
movement or word with her lynx-eyes, and turned each into
the shape that best suited her purpose.</p>

<p>Laurence made Sybil his confidant now with the most perfect
freedom; he told her all his suspicions, his unhappiness
and fears; she gave him back the most touching sympathy,
and such advice as proved satisfactory to his feelings in
every respect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret was too much preoccupied to observe any thing
of this. Miss Chase was so wary and prudent, that she
would have averted the suspicions of a much more jealous
person than her young hostess.</p>

<p>Edward Laurence, even in his anger and wretchedness,
would have shrunk from any deliberate wrong to Margaret;
but, day by day, Sybil's influence over him increased&mdash;day by
day her wiles produced their effect, and placed him more
completely in her dangerous power.</p>

<p>They were conversing one morning in the breakfast-room
before any one else was down&mdash;for Miss Chase persevered in
her habit of early rising, and many long talks and rambles
were taken with an unexpressed understanding of which no
one in the house had the slightest idea.</p>

<p>They were talking of Margaret; she was often the subject
of their conversations, while she lay in her darkened chamber,
trying to forget her ills in broken slumber, which the dreary
watches of the night had refused to give.</p>

<p>"How much Miss Waring enjoys society," Sybil said; "I
am glad that these people happened to come just now&mdash;she
was miserable before."</p>

<p>"Then you pity her for the misfortunes she has brought
upon herself?"</p>

<p>"I pity her all the more on that account."</p>

<p>"I am not so charitable."</p>

<p>"At all events, she is gay and happy now," pursued Sybil.</p>

<p>"Yes; she can be pleasant to all the world except me,"
cried Laurence, bitterly.</p>

<p>"I will not permit you to be unjust," returned Miss Chase.</p>

<p>"You can not deny that she is heartless and capricious;
you admitted as much the other day."</p>

<p>"Did I? Then it was very wrong in me."</p>

<p>"Ah, you have no sympathy with my misery."</p>

<p>"Do not reproach me in this way; you know it is unjust."</p>

<p>"But did you not own you considered her cold and hard?"</p>

<p>"No; I admitted that she was capricious."</p>

<p>"But not heartless?"</p>

<p>"Not at all; I believe her capable of strong, even intense
feeling."</p>

<p>"I have never witnessed any exhibition of it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope she will always remain in ignorance of it herself."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because it would place her in a very unhappy position.
I pity any woman who is liable to make the discovery of such
feelings when it is too late&mdash;when she can but sit down in
passive submission to her destiny."</p>

<p>"Margaret is too impetuous for that."</p>

<p>"Nay, you can not believe that she would fail to resist
such feelings, when marriage made them a sin."</p>

<p>"I have never thought. I do not choose to contemplate
the possibility of a thing like that."</p>

<p>"It is much wiser not."</p>

<p>The words grated unpleasantly on Laurence's ear; he
could not tell why, but a vague suspicion in regard to Margaret
woke in his mind&mdash;once roused, no power could thrust
it aside.</p>

<p>"We go to Highcliff to-day, I believe," Sybil said, after a
pause, too wise ever to push a conversation one step too far.</p>

<p>"Yes; that was decided last night," he answered, moodily.
"I wish these people were gone; I am tired of bustle and confusion.
My own stay in the country should terminate at once,
only the old gentleman won't hear of it."</p>

<p>Miss Chase expressed her entire participation in his weariness,
and noticing that the hands of the clock had crept
round to the hour at which people might be expected to make
their appearance, she went out of the room and did not appear
again until several of the party were gathered in the breakfast-room.</p>

<p>Soon after noon they started upon the expedition to Highcliff,
a lofty mountain that towered over a river which flowed
through the valley in which Mr. Waring's property lay, and
was accessible to the summit by persons on horseback.</p>

<p>It was a large, merry party; Margaret was recklessly gay,
conscious that her lover was watching her, and growing more
excited and determined to appear careless and unconcerned
on that account.</p>

<p>When they reached the top of the mountain, the horses
were left in care of the servants, and the people wandered
about at their pleasure, dividing into little groups and enjoying
themselves as best suited their peculiar idiosyncracies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>Late in the afternoon, Sybil Chase, who had been talking
first with one group then with another, looked about and
missed Margaret and Hinchley; it seemed proper to her, in
her wisdom, that their movements should be watched, and
she flitted hither and yon among the trees in search of them.</p>

<p>Margaret had gone with Hinchley and a young girl, who
had her own object in seeking that part of the woods, in
search of a spring that broke out from the hollow of a charming
little dell near by, filling the woods with its crystalline
music. The hollow was celebrated not only for its spring of
fresh water, but for the bird-songs that rung through it from
morning to night, making the place, in more senses than one,
a paradise.</p>

<p>The friends walked on, enjoying the shadows and sunshine
that played through the branches. Margaret had, really, no
thought of avoiding any of her party; but after Laurence left
her side, she had little care about time or place.</p>

<p>As they came near the dell, Margaret's young friend
changed her mind, as girls of sixteen sometimes will, very
unaccountably. She had seen a certain young gentleman
flitting through the distant shadows, and as his supposed
presence there had brought her toward the spring, a glimpse
of his movements in another direction checked her desire for
a drink of cold water on the instant. But she was seized
with an overpowering hunger for young wintergreen, and
that always grew best on slopes which the sunshine visited
occasionally&mdash;never in hollows.</p>

<p>She mentioned this craving wish with some hesitation, but
Margaret only smiled and said:</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense; time enough for that when we have
seen the spring."</p>

<p>They moved a few paces and came in sight of the dell, a
beautiful hollow shaded with hemlocks, dogwood and wild
honeysuckles.</p>

<p>Fragments of rock lay in the bed of the hollow, through
which a crystal brooklet, born at the spring, crept and murmured
caressingly, sending up its tiny spray, and clothing its
friends, the rocks, with the brightest moss. Water-cresses
shone up through the waves, and speckled trout slept under
the fern-leaves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a delightful place, cool and heavenly; but the young
lady of sixteen saw that figure moving away through the distance,
and grew frantic from fear of snakes. Copperheads and
red-adders, she protested, were always found in just such
places&mdash;she saw one then, creeping around the foot of that
hemlock. So with pretty expostulations and divers shrieks
loud enough to arrest the young man in his covert, she darted
off toward the open glades, where that shadowy figure was
soon busy on his knees gathering young wintergreens for her
benefit.</p>

<p>"Shall we go on?" Margaret asked, when the young lady
had retreated.</p>

<p>"If you are not tired," Hinchley answered. "I should
like to go down very much. The dell is the prettiest spot I
ever saw, and the water delicious."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, it is a lovely spot," Margaret said. "Some day
I intend to make a sketch of it. Let us select the best view."</p>

<p>They went down the descent and stood by the spring, which
rushed out from among the rocks with a pleasant, bell-like
murmur, and cast its tiny shower of spray-bubbles over the
violets that fringed it.</p>

<p>"How still it is," Margaret observed.</p>

<p>"Yes; it is refreshing to escape from all that chatter.
How constantly people do talk."</p>

<p>"Yet if one is silent, it is to be considered stupid."</p>

<p>"But stupidity would be a relief sometimes."</p>

<p>Margaret did not answer; she was busy with her own
thoughts. When Hinchley spoke again it was of other things.
He had been shocked at finding so much changed at the
homestead, for the old gentleman now saw no visitors and
seldom left his room, and Ralph felt that he ought to make
Margaret understand how little hope there was that she could
much longer have her uncle's house as a place of protection.</p>

<p>Margaret wept bitterly; but when he attempted to speak
of Laurence, or allude to her marriage, she only turned passionately
away, with bitter, haughty words that made Ralph
fear both for her and his friend.</p>

<p>While they stood talking by the spring, Sybil Chase moved
softly through the underbrush and looked down at them.
After a moment's silent watch, she went back toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
place where she had left Laurence conversing with a group of
persons who had become tired of wandering among the trees.</p>

<p>She remained a little way off from the party, and very soon
he took occasion to join her. They began to converse, and
gradually walked down the hill. Sybil did not appear to be
leading him to any particular spot, but was walking as absently
along as himself. She paused on a rise of ground which
commanded a view of the dell. Sybil watched Laurence, but
stood with her face turned from the spring. He caught sight
of the pair standing in the dell&mdash;gave a quick start, while the
color shot up to his forehead.</p>

<p>"Are you ill?" Sybil asked, gently.</p>

<p>"Look down there," he replied, pointing to Margaret and
Hinchley, who were absorbed in conversation, Ralph holding
his cousin's hand, while she wept unrestrainedly.</p>

<p>"It is Margaret," said Sybil.</p>

<p>"And Hinchley."</p>

<p>"They have come to see the spring."</p>

<p>"I perceive, Miss Chase;" he spoke bitterly.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Mr. Laurence&mdash;you are not jealous? He is her
cousin."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I am displeased."</p>

<p>"It means nothing at all."</p>

<p>"But it does not look well. I can see you think so.</p>

<p>"It may be a little imprudent, but you know Margaret is
very impulsive. Shall we go down?"</p>

<p>"We will not disturb them."</p>

<p>"Don't look so stern, Mr. Laurence; you really frighten me."</p>

<p>"There is no cause for alarm. The moment Margaret
convinces me that she is a flirt, I shall feel only contempt for
her."</p>

<p>"I am sure she is not in fault," returned Sybil. "I never
saw her encourage the slightest attention from any gentleman
before."</p>

<p>"True&mdash;I had not thought of that."</p>

<p>He frowned, black and angry, bit his lip and reflected.</p>

<p>"You meant something then which I did not comprehend,"
said Miss Chase.</p>

<p>"I was reflecting. I never saw Margaret on such friendly
terms with any man before. It makes me think the more
seriously of this."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"Great heavens, Mr. Laurence, you can not suspect her!
Hinchley is her cousin. They have been dear friends from
childhood."</p>

<p>"She is my betrothed wife. She has no right to make
herself a subject of comment."</p>

<p>"Come away!" she exclaimed, quickly; "come away!"</p>

<p>She took his hand and drew him back into the path.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," she repeated several times. "I am convinced
that you are angry without cause."</p>

<p>"I believe so," replied Laurence&mdash;"I must believe it! But
Margaret had better take care. I have borne a great deal.
She shall not, by her folly or her vanity, make me ridiculous,
nor will I be made a dupe."</p>

<p>"Such words, Mr. Laurence!"</p>

<p>"I mean them! As for Hinchley, if he make trouble
between Margaret and me, I shall hold him guilty as if she
were my wife."</p>

<p>Sybil sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"Of what are you thinking?" asked Laurence.</p>

<p>"I hardly know&mdash;I can not tell."</p>

<p>"I see that you are troubled," he said, violently. "Sybil,
you have called yourself my friend; answer me: do you
believe that Hinchley loves Margaret?"</p>

<p>Sybil hesitated; her head was averted, as if she could not
bear to meet his earnest gaze.</p>

<p>"I have ceased to believe that she cares greatly for me.
Tell me if you think Hinchley is more to her than a cousin
and friend."</p>

<p>"Do not ask me; mine are only vague suspicions. I can
not be the one to destroy your last hope of happiness."</p>

<p>"I am answered," he said, gloomily.</p>

<p>"No, no; I will not&mdash;I can not answer! Look for yourself,
Mr. Laurence. I may be wrong. I have very strict
and, what people might think, singular ideas. Oh! don't
mind what I have said."</p>

<p>"I will see for myself," he answered, recklessly. "Let me
once be convinced, and I shall leave her forever. Oh, Sybil!
you are my friend&mdash;the only one to whom I can turn for
sympathy."</p>

<p>Sybil buried her face in her hands and burst into tears;
but when he attempted to question her, she broke from him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let me go!" she exclaimed. "I blush for my own weakness.
Let me go, Edward Laurence!"</p>

<p>She hurried away, leaving him bewildered and troubled.
For the first time he felt dimly that Sybil loved him, and the
consciousness brought a host of inexplicable feelings to his
heart. She looked so lovely in her distress&mdash;her gentleness,
in contrast with Margaret's violence and ill-temper, was so
touching, that her image lingered in his imagination&mdash;the only
ray of light in all the blackness which surrounded him.</p>

<p>As Hinchley and his cousin passed up the hill, they saw
Sybil Chase conversing with a little group of friends.</p>

<p>"I have a horror of that woman," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yet she seems a quiet, sensible person," replied Margaret.
"I have allowed myself to become prejudiced against her;
but when I am in her society I forget it all."</p>

<p>Hinchley did not answer. The remembrance of that terrible
night in California came back, as was always the case,
when Sybil Chase came in sight. Her figure started up
instead of the woman he had but half seen, and he turned
from the thought with self-abhorrence&mdash;it was wicked to
indulge it even for an instant.</p>

<p>While they stood together, Laurence approached, pale and
agitated, like a man under the excitement of wine.</p>

<p>"Edward!" Hinchley called out, cheerfully. "Laurence,
is it not almost time to go home?"</p>

<p>"I suppose you are at liberty to choose your own time,"
replied Laurence, insolently.</p>

<p>Margaret colored scarlet; an insult to her cousin seemed
given to herself.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Ralph, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Oh, pay no attention," interposed Margaret, before Laurence
could reply. "It is only a slight specimen of Mr.
Laurence's civility. He is not satisfied with being rude to me,
but must extend his bad manners to my relatives."</p>

<p>"You are at liberty to put any construction you please
upon my words or manner," returned Laurence. "I shall
not account to either of you."</p>

<p>"To me it is a matter of perfect indifference," said Margaret,
haughtily.</p>

<p>Ralph looked from one to the other in pain and astonishment,
at a loss what to say or do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now don't quarrel like children," he exclaimed, trying to
laugh. "Come, shake hands and be friends."</p>

<p>"Miss Waring's conduct proves how sincerely she desires
to be friends," answered Laurence, with a harsh laugh.</p>

<p>"I do not wish it," she exclaimed, greatly irritated by his
manner.</p>

<p>"Margaret! Margaret!" pleaded Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't check her," sneered Laurence.</p>

<p>"He can not," returned Margaret. "I am weary of this
rudeness&mdash;weary of you."</p>

<p>"Say and do what you please; I will leave you in more
agreeable society," said Laurence, hurrying away.</p>

<p>Hinchley tried to expostulate with her, but words were
thrown away. During the ride home, and the whole evening,
Margaret and Laurence did not speak. Ralph kept near her,
anxious to soothe her anger, while Laurence and Sybil Chase
watched every movement and look.</p>

<p>Thus, with her proud spirit up in arms, and her heart
aching with wounded tenderness, the poor girl rushed into
the snare so insidiously laid beneath her feet.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE JAIL.</p>


<p>In one of the interior towns of California there stands a
jail, by no means striking in appearance, or remarkable for
its solidity or strength, yet possessing the horrible fascination
which any place connected with tragic deeds fastens on the
mind.</p>

<p>Within that prison many notable criminals had been confined;
murders had been committed there by hardened men,
daring every thing in a struggle for liberty; many a reckless
criminal had gone from thence to the gallows; even youths,
with the freshness of boyhood on their cheeks, had gone out
from those walls to a violent death, incited to evil doing and
crime by the very lawlessness and sin about them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>In one of the cells upon the upper floor, a single occupant
was seated, crouched down upon a bench, and his eyes
moodily fixed upon the small grated window which looked
out upon a sort of paved court around which the jail was
built.</p>

<p>The prisoner might have been a man of thirty-five, but in
that dim light, with his unshaven beard, and face pale from
inactivity and confinement, it was difficult to judge accurately
of his age.</p>

<p>The countenance was harsh and unpleasant, but the expression
was rather that of reckless passion than revealing any
stern, sinister determination. His frame was large and muscular,
the veins were knotted and swollen upon his pale hands,
and it was indeed pitiable to see so much physical strength
wasting in the gloom of a prison.</p>

<p>Sometimes his lips moved; the restless flashing of his eyes
betrayed the brooding thought within his mind. At last he
rose suddenly, took the bench upon which he had been sitting,
and lifted it, as if anxious to test his strength. He held it
extended upon the fingers of his right hand in a manner
which required no inconsiderable force. Then he set it down
upon the floor, abruptly as he had raised it, and laughed a
low, smothered laugh.</p>

<p>"Not quite a baby yet," he muttered&mdash;"not quite! I can
do it, and I will. I have got out of worse scrapes than this&mdash;fudge,
what's this place compared to Australia?"</p>

<p>A low imprecation finished the sentence, then he resumed
his seat, and began his meditations anew. But quiet seemed
impossible to him in the mood into which he had worked
himself.</p>

<p>He rose again, carried the bench to the window, and, standing
upon it, managed to leap high enough to grasp the
gratings. There he suspended himself, with his whole weight
resting upon his hands, and looked out. When he had
finished his survey, he loosed his hold and dropped lightly
upon the bench.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he whispered to himself. "I know the
place. It can be done, and I am the man to do it."</p>

<p>It was then somewhat after midday, and, as the man
resumed his seat, there was a tread without, a sound of keys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
grating in their lock, then the door opened and the jailer
entered, carrying a sparse meal, which he set down near the
prisoner.</p>

<p>The man looked up and nodded good-naturedly enough.</p>

<p>"I thought you didn't mean to let me have any dinner,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't want to starve you," returned the jailer.
"Eat and make yourself comfortable."</p>

<p>It was no unusual thing for the prisoner to engage this man
in conversation, and if he was in the mood he answered
readily and with sufficient kindness.</p>

<p>"What day of the month is this?" asked the man, preparing
to attack the repast set before him.</p>

<p>"The twelfth."</p>

<p>"How a fellow loses his count in this miserable hole,"
returned the prisoner.</p>

<p>"Don't slander your quarters, there's worse in the world;
ten to one you've been in 'em."</p>

<p>"Maybe so and maybe not. I say, California sheep get
pretty tough, now don't they?" he continued, tearing vigorously
at the baked mutton which had been placed before him.</p>

<p>"Makes a man strong to eat tough mutton," replied the
jailer.</p>

<p>"Think so?" and the prisoner smiled a little, unseen by
his companion.</p>

<p>"I'm sure of it," said the jailer.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you've had your turn at it," observed the man.</p>

<p>"Can't say I ever did, and don't want to."</p>

<p>"You needn't; still it's not so bad that one can't bear it."</p>

<p>The jailer prepared to retire.</p>

<p>"You're a cheerful, good-natured fellow, any how," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my way."</p>

<p>"And a good deal better than being so cantankerous as
some chaps we have here; they only get harder treatment."</p>

<p>The prisoner agreed with him completely, and with some
other careless remark, the jailer left the cell.</p>

<p>When the door closed, and he heard the heavy bolts clang
into their sockets, the prisoner muttered:</p>

<p>"If I have to throttle you to-night, you won't think so well
of my good-nature."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>He laughed again, as if there had been something amusing
in the thought, and finished his meal with as much dispatch
as if some important business awaited its completion.</p>

<p>But when all was done, he had only to resume his silent
watch, varying it by pacing up and down the narrow cell,
and performing a variety of gymnastic feats, which seemed an
unnecessary waste of muscle and strength.</p>

<p>So the afternoon wore by. The sunset came in; its faint
gold streamed across the floor, and attracted the prisoner's eye.
He rose, stretching out his hands as if to grasp it.</p>

<p>"This looks like freedom," he muttered. "It's a warning."</p>

<p>The superstition appeared to gratify him, and he remained
in the same position until the brightness faded, and the gray
shadows of twilight began to fill the room.</p>

<p>"It's gone," he said; "so much the better; I shall follow
all the sooner."</p>

<p>He sat down again and waited. His restlessness and
impatience had disappeared; a strong determination settled
upon his face. He looked prepared for any emergency, and was
ready to catch at any chance, however desperate, which might
aid his plans.</p>

<p>The lamp in the corridor had been lighted while he sat
there; the light struggled through the grating over the door,
and played across the room among the shadows cast by the
bars.</p>

<p>There he sat, listening to every sound from without with
the stealthy quiet of a panther that sees his prey and is prepared
to spring.</p>

<p>An hour might have passed before the jailer's heavy tread
again sounded upon the pavement; he was whistling a merry
tune, that rung strangely enough among those gloomy corridors
and darkened cells.</p>

<p>When the prisoner heard the step pause before his door, he
took from his bed the thick woolen blankets which lay upon
it and, grasping them in his hand, crept quietly behind the
door.</p>

<p>The key turned in the lock, the heavy door swung upon its
hinges with a sound so mournful and ominous, that had the
man who entered been at all imaginative, he might have taken
it for a warning. But he passed on, interrupting his song to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
call out something in a cheerful voice, but the prisoner did
not answer.</p>

<p>"He must be asleep," muttered the jailer. "Well, well,
poor chap, he hain't much else to do!"</p>

<p>He moved toward the bed, saying:</p>

<p>"Here, wake up, lazybones, and eat your supper before it
gets cold."</p>

<p>The door swung slowly to its latch, but he did not heed
the warning; a step sounded behind him, but before he could
turn or cry out, the heavy blanket was thrown over his head,
almost smothering him in its folds, and an iron grasp crushed
him down upon the floor.</p>

<p>"Lie still, or I'll murder you," whispered a stern, hard
voice.</p>

<p>The jailer's only response was a half-choked gurgle in his
throat; whatever his courage or strength might have been, he
was entirely powerless.</p>

<p>The prisoner continued his preparations with the utmost
quiet; bound the unfortunate man to the iron bedstead, and
so completely enveloped him in the blanket, that there was
not the slightest hope of his extricating himself.</p>

<p>Stealthily the prisoner moved to the door, and looked down
the corridor dimly lighted by a lamp at the further end. No
one was stirring; at that hour the people employed in the jail
were at their supper, as the man well knew, so that he found
little risk of being observed.</p>

<p>He locked the door behind him, put the keys in his pocket,
to be flung away when once beyond the walls, and walked
rapidly but silently down the passage.</p>

<p>He was perfectly familiar with every winding and outlet
of the prison, and moved hurriedly along through the shadows,
down the stairs, along a back passage, where no guard was
stationed as it communicated directly with the kitchens, and
reached the outer door.</p>

<p>There he paused an instant, to be certain that he had made
no mistake, looking about with as much composure as though
he had been already beyond the danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>He had been in more terrible positions than that; had
listened to the infuriated shouts of a mob thirsting for his
life; had seen the body of a companion swung from a tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
before his very eyes; and yet, amid all the horror and terror,
had preserved his courage and presence of mind sufficiently to
make his way among the very men who were hunting him
down with the fury of bloodhounds.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The jailer in the dark cell had managed,
with his teeth and nails, to enlarge a rent in the blanket
sufficiently to extricate his head. His feet were pinioned, but
he crept along the pavement to the door, and beat heavily against
the bars to summon assistance from without; but nothing
answered, save the echo of his frantic cries and the sharp
blows upon the barred oak.</p>

<p>Away out upon a little eminence, that still from the distance
commanded a view of the prison, stood the escaped criminal,
casting a last glance back upon the weather-stained walls.
He lifted his hand with a gesture of mockery and exultation,
plunged down the hill, and was lost amid the dense woods
that spread out for miles beyond.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE DUEL.</p>


<p>Mr. Waring's old housekeeper was ill&mdash;a most unusual
misfortune to befall her, and one which she could not at first
either realize or believe. She struggled against this sudden
malady with all the energy and obstinacy of her nature; but
she was at length forced to take to her bed and let the fever
have its course, while she grumbled and snarled at every
mortal who approached, and gave the poor girl who was
obliged to take care of her a precious life indeed.</p>

<p>But while the old lady lay snapping and rabid with fever,
affairs in the house did not go on smoothly at all, and nervous
Mr. Waring nearly fretted himself into a fever which almost
equaled that which had taken such sharp hold of his rebellious
housekeeper.</p>

<p>Margaret was busy with her own troubles; and, besides,
she was affected with that horror of domestic matters, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
I am sorry to say, is so common among my youthful country-women,
and entirely neglected to interest herself in the
domestic annoyances that beset them.</p>

<p>In the mean time the servants ran riot below stairs, and,
as several of them were new-comers, belonging to the Celtic
race into the bargain, they took such advantage of the housekeeper's
absence that it soon became doubtful whether they
would condescend to prepare meals for any portion of the
family except that which reigned in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. Waring sent for Miss Chase to his room for consultation.
The lady was all sweetness and affability, declared her
willingness to do every thing in her power to restore the
household to order, but more than hinted that Margaret would
not permit her to interfere.</p>

<p>Of course the old gentleman was in a sad way, but poor
Meg's health had become so delicate that he did not venture
to speak with her upon the subject; and the only thing he
could do was to listen favorably to any proposal which Miss
Chase made.</p>

<p>"I will go down to town this very morning," she said,
"and I am very certain that I shall return with a woman
perfectly competent to take charge of your household."</p>

<p>When she saw how Mr. Waring brightened at that information,
she added another touch of comfort:</p>

<p>"I have the address somewhere of a woman who once
lived for a time with Mrs. Pierson. If I can find her, she
will suit you admirably."</p>

<p>The matter was satisfactorily arranged. Mr. Waring began
to look upon Sybil as a sort of guardian-angel; and she bade
him good-morning with her sweetest smile to make preparations
for her expedition.</p>

<p>Sybil returned from the city that night accompanied by a
respectable elderly female, who set about her duties in such a
quiet, understanding way that everybody was delighted and
something like peace restored.</p>

<p>Of course the old housekeeper grumbled more than ever,
and was prepared to consider the stranger the most abominable
of her sex; but no one paid much attention, and, as every
spasm of rage only increased her fever, and she was quite
incapable of controlling her temper, there seemed every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
probability that placid Mrs. Brown would hold the reins of
government in her chubby fingers for some time to come.</p>

<p>And now events began to thicken about that once cheerful
house on the river, and those miserable young beings were
urged forward to the last act of anger and injustice which
should consummate their misery. The net which Sybil had
woven had been slowly and securely drawn about them, and
now the opportunity was offered which completed the work
she had so skillfully arranged.</p>

<p>The estrangement between Laurence and Margaret was
daily gaining strength. Laurence began really to believe
that he hated her, and the fascination which Sybil had thrown
about him became enthralling. He came to the house now
merely to hold long, confidential conversations with her, and
from every one he retired more completely bewildered and
enslaved.</p>

<p>He had quarreled with Hinchley, although the young man
remained at the house as his uncle's invited guest. He was
deeply pained by the state of affairs, and still hoped to reunite
his cousin and friend.</p>

<p>It might have been a fortnight after the installation of Mrs.
Brown when Sybil and Laurence were walking in the shrubbery
at some distance from the house.</p>

<p>They saw Hinchley pass down a neighboring path in full
view of the spot where they stood, although he was unconscious
of their presence. Laurence muttered bitter execrations
against the intruder; and while Sybil was soothing him, they
saw the new housekeeper go cautiously down the path and
join Hinchley. She gave him a note and stole away again.</p>

<p>"I understand now," whispered Laurence. "She is made
a medium of communication between that man and Margaret.
She shall tell me the truth, or I will annihilate her."</p>

<p>He drew Sybil forward and stood directly in the path as
Mrs. Brown approached. When she saw them, the woman
started back with every evidence of fear and confusion; but
Laurence grasped her roughly by the arm.</p>

<p>"You gave that man a note from Miss Margaret," he said.</p>

<p>The woman began to cry at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, don't make me lose my place! I couldn't refuse
the young lady! Do speak a word for me, Miss Chase. I
mean to be faithful. I didn't mean any harm."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you have carried notes between them before?"
demanded Laurence.</p>

<p>"I didn't know it was wrong&mdash;indeed I didn't. Tell him
I am an honest woman, Miss Chase."</p>

<p>"Go into the house, Brown," said the lady, coldly. "I
am disappointed in you."</p>

<p>Laurence released her arm, and she darted away wringing
her hands in sad distress. Laurence made a step toward the
place where Hinchley stood reading the letter with a look of
doubt and astonishment.</p>

<p>"Stop," whispered Sybil. "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Take that letter&mdash;know the truth."</p>

<p>She attempted to plead with him, but he pushed her aside
and strode toward Hinchley. The young man looked up,
startled at his unexpected approach, and made a movement
to conceal the note in his hand.</p>

<p>"Give me that letter!" exclaimed Laurence, in a hoarse
voice.</p>

<p>"A very singular demand, sir," returned Hinchley, coldly.</p>

<p>"I will have it&mdash;the proof of your treachery and hers&mdash;you
miserable coward!"</p>

<p>He sprung forward, seized Hinchley in his infuriated grasp,
and a short but severe struggle took place. At last, Laurence
flung his opponent back and seized the note.</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" exclaimed Hinchley. "Give back that
paper."</p>

<p>"Never! I will read it!"</p>

<p>Sybil saw that she must interfere, or Laurence would not
be permitted to open the sheet; so she hurried up with hysteric
sobs, and threw her arms about Hinchley.</p>

<p>"No violence!" she sobbed. "Oh, don't quarrel, Mr.
Hinchley, don't."</p>

<p>While he vainly tried to extricate himself from her hold,
Laurence tore open the letter and read it. He would hardly
have been human had he not given way to the storm of fury
which swept over him.</p>

<p>The writing was Margaret's, the letter signed with her
name, and it revealed the story of her wretchedness, her desire
to free herself from her engagement, and her belief that she
was loved by Hinchley. The note went on to say that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
need have no scruples about seeking her hand, as she was
determined never to marry Laurence.</p>

<p>The young man dropped the letter with a groan.</p>

<p>Sybil released Hinchley, whose anger seemed to have
changed to pity at the sight of his former friend's distress.</p>

<p>"She never wrote it, Laurence," he exclaimed. "I would
pledge my life on it."</p>

<p>"Who then?" he answered. "Is there another woman on
earth brazen enough to have written it?"</p>

<p>"How can I tell? But I would stake my life that it is a
forgery."</p>

<p>He glanced at Sybil; something in her attitude brought
back his old suspicions, but they were so vague, her innocence
in the present matter so apparent, that it would have
seemed madness to have spoken of them. Again Laurence
turned upon him most furiously, and hurled such terrible
epithets and charges against him, that no man of courage
could have endured them.</p>

<p>Sybil Chase left the two men pale with wrath, and rushed
away, not frightened at what she had done, but believing it
wiser for her to escape from the scene; for language had
been employed on both sides that could only end in apologies
or deadly violence. Hinchley was wrought to a pitch of
frenzy nearly equal to that which convulsed Laurence.</p>

<p>He grasped eagerly at a defiance which fell from his opponent.</p>

<p>"When you will," he answered. "You will find me
always ready to vindicate my honor."</p>

<p>"So be it," returned Laurence. "Before sunset to-night,
let your life or mine pay the forfeit; we can not breathe the
same air another day."</p>

<p>Before they parted it was settled&mdash;angrily settled&mdash;that two
school friends, men who had been intimate and loving as
brothers, should stand face to face, each opposed to his murderer.
This is the true word. Call duelling the only resource
of wounded honor if you will; it is murder, after all&mdash;murder
the most atrocious, from its very coolness and premeditation.</p>

<p>Hinchley broke away abruptly, after having regained possession
of the fatal letter, and Laurence rushed toward the
house to find Margaret, and overwhelm her with his knowledge
of her weakness and treachery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>It had been a dark, wretched day to the girl, passed
between the sick chamber of her uncle and that of the old
housekeeper. Mr. Waring had been seized with one of his
violent attacks, and was lying dangerously ill. Exhausted
with watching, Margaret found an opportunity to rest, and
went down stairs to the library, meeting Sybil Chase in the
hall.</p>

<p>"Will you go and sit with my uncle for a while, Miss
Chase?" she asked, wearily.</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Sybil, somewhat flurried after her
escape from the garden, but concealing her emotion with her
usual success. "You look quite worn out; it would do you
good to sleep."</p>

<p>Margaret passed on without vouchsafing a reply; her dislike
of the woman had grown into absolute aversion during
the past days, and it was with difficulty that she could force
herself to receive her advances with common civility.</p>

<p>Margaret entered the library, closed the door and threw
herself upon a couch, hoping for a time to forget her distress
and bitter feelings in slumber. She fell asleep at once, and was
aroused from an incoherent dream by the violent opening of
the door, and a hoarse voice called out:</p>

<p>"Margaret&mdash;Margaret Waring?"</p>

<p>She started up, confused by the abrupt awakening, and
with a vague impression that her uncle had been taken suddenly
worse; but she saw Laurence standing before her, livid
with passion. Margaret rose at once, and coldly said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Laurence, you will please come into a room which I
occupy, somewhat less boisterously."</p>

<p>"I grieve exceedingly to have disturbed your delicate
nerves," he replied, with a hoarse laugh; "but I have that
to say which will possibly shock them still more."</p>

<p>She gave him a haughty glance, which roused his fury to
still greater violence.</p>

<p>"Nothing you could do would shock me," she said. "I
am prepared for any thing."</p>

<p>"Then you are prepared to hear that I have discovered
your falsehood and treachery! Miserable, cowardly girl, why
did you not come frankly and tell me the truth?"</p>

<p>Her pride rose to meet the passion which flamed in his
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Laurence," she exclaimed, "I have borne a great
deal from you; but you shall not insult me in this house!"</p>

<p>"Why did you not say to me frankly&mdash;I detest this marriage?"
he continued. "Do you think I would not have freed
you at once?"</p>

<p>"I do not know what you mean," she answered, trembling
with angry astonishment at his words. "But let me tell you
now, I do dread it&mdash;loathe the very thought of it."</p>

<p>"So this you wrote to him," he exclaimed. "I have seen
the letter! Why, shame on you, Margaret Waring! I would
not have believed you thus lost to all womanly pride. What!
tell man unsought that you loved him? and you honorably
bound to another."</p>

<p>She stared at him in angry surprise&mdash;her lips apart, her
wild eyes full of scornful incredulity.</p>

<p>"You have been dreaming, or you are crazy," she said.</p>

<p>"Neither the one nor the other; but I know every thing."</p>

<p>"I do not understand you," she replied, relapsing into the
haughty coldness which always enraged him more than any
bitter words that she could speak.</p>

<p>"Oh, do not add another falsehood to the list!" he exclaimed.
"Haven't you perjured your soul enough, already?
I tell you that I read the letter you wrote to Ralph Hinchley.
I have watched you for weeks; I know the whole extent of
your shameful duplicity."</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Margaret. "I will endure no more! Leave
this house, Mr. Laurence, at once, and forever! While we
both live, I will never see your face again; my uncle decides
this night, between you and me; either he confirms what I
now say, or I will leave his house."</p>

<p>"So be it; do not think I regret it! Why, I came here
only to expose and cast you off. Your uncle shall see that
letter. I will have it, or tear it from Hinchley's heart. When
Waring has read that, we shall see what he thinks of his dainty
niece."</p>

<p>"Of all this passion I do not comprehend one word; but it
wearies me. Go, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you dare deny having written to Ralph Hinchley
that you loved him&mdash;that you were ready to abandon your
engagement and marry him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" groaned Margaret, almost fainting from a sharp
recoil of outraged feeling, "is there no man living who will
avenge me on this libeler?"</p>

<p>"He may, perhaps, avenge you; why not?" retorted
Laurence; "but answer. You shall answer and confess this
duplicity, or blacken your soul with another lie. Did you
write to Hinchley?"</p>

<p>"I did," said Margaret; "a note of three lines, asking him
to pay a bill for me at Desmond's."</p>

<p>"Margaret! Margaret! this effrontery only makes it more
unbearable," he cried. "I will expose you to the whole
world."</p>

<p>"Do what you please&mdash;say what you choose, but leave this
house, and never let me see you again."</p>

<p>"I go willingly. Farewell forever, Margaret! I do not
curse; time will do that, and I can wait."</p>

<p>He dashed out of the room, pale and fierce with contending
passions, and hurried from her presence.</p>

<p>Margaret stood upright until the door closed, then her
hands fell to her side, a low moan broke from her lips, and
she dropped senseless upon the couch.</p>

<p>It was near sunset when she came to herself again; Sybil
Chase was bending over her, bathing her forehead and using
words of tender solicitude, while a little way off stood the new
housekeeper, apparently quite overcome with distress.</p>

<p>Margaret pushed Miss Chase away, and would have left the
room without a word, but Sybil caught her arm, while a
strange light shot into her eyes.</p>

<p>"I must detain you a moment," she said. "Your uncle
has been seized with a frightful attack; the physician is with
him now."</p>

<p>"What caused it?" demanded Margaret.</p>

<p>"Mr. Laurence was with him," faltered Sybil.</p>

<p>Margaret turned upon her with cold scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Miss Chase," she said, "I believe on my soul that you are
at the bottom of all this trouble. I desire you to quit the
house at once."</p>

<p>Sybil pleaded, wept, and demanded an explanation, but
Margaret broke from her, and hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>"What is to come now?" whispered the woman, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
close to Sybil, who stood looking after Margaret, and smiling
as only women like her can smile.</p>

<p>"She has done exactly what I desired," she answered. "I
shall leave this house in an hour; you will go with me."</p>

<p>"But the duel?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that drives me frantic; but I believe Hinchley will be
the sufferer&mdash;I should go mad else! Pack my things, and
meet me at the station in an hour."</p>

<p>She hurried away, without giving the woman time to speak,
and left the house at once.</p>

<p>Sybil took her way rapidly through the grounds, crossed
the high road, and ran through the fields until she reached a
lofty ascent, from whence she could command a view of the
broad sandy plain beneath.</p>

<p>She was only just in time; there she stood, and gazed
below with the same expression her face had worn upon the
night when she watched her husband's frightful death in the
wilds of California.</p>

<p>Only a few paces from each other stood Laurence and
Ralph Hinchley; each held a pistol in his hand, and even as
Sybil looked, one of the seconds gave the word.</p>

<p>There was a simultaneous report, a blinding flash, and
when the smoke cleared away, Sybil saw Hinchley stretched
upon the ground, the two assistants bending over him, and
Laurence standing in his old position.</p>

<p>She heard one of the men say:</p>

<p>"Save yourself, Laurence;" then Hinchley called out:</p>

<p>"Not yet&mdash;not yet; it is only my arm; there is no danger.
Edward, believe me, Margaret never wrote that letter. Keep
her name out of this quarrel. It will yet be explained."</p>

<p>Laurence only replied by a gesture of dissent. The
seconds raised the wounded man, bore him to a carriage
which was stationed a little way off, placed him upon the
seat, and the party drove away.</p>

<p>Laurence stood like a statue, gazing moodily upon the
pistol he grasped in his hand.</p>

<p>Sybil hurried down the bank, calling out:</p>

<p>"Laurence! Laurence!"</p>

<p>He turned at her approach, flung the pistol away, and
caught her in his arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am revenged," he said. "I have nothing left in the
world but you, Sybil Chase. Oh, say that you love me!"</p>

<p>The long expected moment had arrived, and, regardless of
the sins by which that painful bliss had been purchased, Sybil
Chase folded her white arms around his neck and gave passionate
expression to the wild love that had burned in her
heart for years.</p>

<p>Now the great object of her misguided life was attained.
She was free from the man who had been a terrible barrier
between them. The engagement was broken by her own
arts. With all this, why was there so much pain left in her
heart? Why did she tremble so violently in the first clasp of
his arms?</p>

<p class="chaptitle">THE BATTERY.</p>


<p>Several days passed, and more miserable ones never
dawned upon the household at Brooklawn.</p>

<p>Gerald Waring was dead. The excitement into which he had
been thrown by Laurence's insane story, the passionate denunciations
of Margaret, and the unaccountable departure of Sybil
Chase had brought on a recurrence of his disease more violent
than any sufferings that had preceded, and before noon the
next day he was a corpse.</p>

<p>Margaret sat alone in her room, desolate and almost maddened
by the events of the past days. Her uncle was dead,
and now she stood in the world utterly alone. He was the
last of her family, the only human being upon whom she had
the slightest claim of kindred save the slight clue of blood
that bound her to Ralph Hinchley.</p>

<p>Waring's property, never very extensive, had been heavily
mortgaged to gratify his expensive tastes and invalid caprices.
Brooklawn must be sold, and after that painful event Margaret
must go forth into the world homeless and desolate. Selfish
and thoughtless as Waring was, he would have made some
provision for his niece, but that he was confident of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
marriage with Laurence, by which she would be placed in a
position far beyond all need of assistance. Thus assured, the
weak man dismissed the matter entirely from his mind, and
thought only of his present comforts.</p>

<p>Margaret had seen Hinchley and learned every thing from
him. The truth only aroused her pride more forcibly. There
was no relenting in her purpose; though broken, miserable,
and beset with poverty, she would have rejected Laurence had
he knelt before her pleading for pardon. Her proud heart
had been more revolted at the fact that he could doubt her
truth than by all the cruelty of his conduct.</p>

<p>Gerald Waring was buried. He had lived in small things,
and his life was of little value to any human being, except
Margaret. She, poor girl, mourned him greatly; and as the
days passed into weeks, and it became necessary for her to
think of another home, her loneliness and desolation increased
into absolute dejection.</p>

<p>When Hinchley recovered from his wound sufficiently to
go out, he visited Margaret several times; but was quite
unable to throw any light upon the mystery which surrounded
them, save the bare facts of the quarrel and separation.</p>

<p>Sybil Chase had settled herself in comfortable lodgings in
New York, and there Laurence visited her daily. With each
day his wounded pride grew more sensitive, and his condemnation
of Margaret increased. Sybil knew how to strengthen
the infatuation which bound him within the spell of her
influence, and thus her control became supreme.</p>

<p>Hinchley could not meet Laurence&mdash;he knew the utter folly
of any attempt at reconciliation. His own feelings toward
the unhappy man were those of profound pity. He was
certain that Edward loved Margaret&mdash;that the only hope of
happiness for either in this world lay in a cordial understanding
of the truth. Thus he determined to spare no pains in
clearing up the utter darkness which enveloped their lives,
and in restoring them to the brightness of that early dream
which had made life so beautiful to both while it lasted.</p>

<p>Still, though the weeks passed and the beautiful spring
deepened into summer, nothing occurred which could give
Hinchley the least clue. In his own mind he fairly believed
Sybil Chase the author of all that terrible unhappiness, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
with these thoughts there came back a recollection of that
night in California, when his life was so nearly sacrificed.
He reproached himself for connecting her with those images,
but could not drive the fearful thought away. Always, when
he recalled that awful struggle, the chamber in the old house,
and the quick retribution dealt to his assailant, there rose
before him the dim figure of that woman in the distance, and
always behind the shrouding shadows he saw the features of
Sybil Chase.</p>

<p>Watching and waiting, he neglected all business and every
personal interest. He walked the streets, meditating upon
those inexplicable occurrences, haunted every spot that Sybil
Chase frequented, but all without result; when the day was
over he could only return to Margaret, and find her pale, ill,
and heart-broken as he had left her.</p>

<p>Some errand connected with that all-engrossing affair carried
him, one day, into a street which led to the Battery; he
had obtained a clue to the residence of Mrs. Brown, and was
following it up with a hope that she might be bribed or frightened
into some revelation which would tend to make his
course more clear.</p>

<p>A California steamer had just arrived at its wharf, and the
eager crowd came surging up the street along which Hinchley
was slowly sauntering in a painful revery. He looked with
idle curiosity from face to face of the motley throng, glad of
any event which would for a moment take his thoughts from
the mournful subject which had so long engrossed him.</p>

<p>Suddenly he beheld upon the other side of the way a face
which brought him to an abrupt pause, while an exclamation,
almost of terror, broke from his lips. After the first glance
of uncertainty, the firm, severe look natural to his features
passed over them.</p>

<p>The man who had disturbed him so walked by, unconscious
of his scrutiny. The face was pale from sickness or
confinement, the long beard had been shaven, the dress was
altered, but through all the change Hinchley recognized him.
That image was too closely connected with the most fearful
era in his life ever to be forgotten.</p>

<p>After the first instant of horror and surprise, his active
mind centered upon itself; the opportunity at least of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
identifying Sybil Chase with the woman he had seen was
offered. What might follow he dared not think of&mdash;the hope
was too great and joyous in the midst of so much suffering.</p>

<p>He turned and followed the man swiftly; came up to him
in a narrow and almost deserted street and laid his hand
upon his shoulder. The stranger started like an escaped
prisoner who felt the grasp of his pursuers upon him; but
when he saw Ralph Hinchley's face, he uttered a cry and
endeavored to break away. But the young man held him
fast, and a few rapid words reassured the fugitive so much
that he walked quietly by his side and listened to him doubtfully,
glancing around like a wild animal in fear of pursuit,
and ready at the slightest sound to take flight.</p>

<p>"It is useless to deny what I say," was the conclusion of
Hinchley's hasty address. "I mean you no harm. Only
answer my questions, and you may go."</p>

<p>"Speak out then," returned the man, sullenly; "though I
don't know why the deuce I should let a man I never saw
before come up and question me in this way."</p>

<p>"You remember me, and did from the first," replied Hinchley,
regarding him with keen decision. "Your eyes waver&mdash;you
are pale, too. This is cowardly. Come, man, you need
not be afraid; for any thing I shall do you are safe enough.
What I want is the truth, and not even that about yourself."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the man, laughing in a reckless way, "the
truth is not difficult to tell about other people, though I am
out of practice."</p>

<p>After a little more persuasion, he followed Hinchley on to
the Battery, and, sitting down under a tree, they conversed
eagerly. Very soon all doubt and fear left the man's face, a
stern passion and fierce exultation lit every feature, while from
Ralph Hinchley's faded the shadow and gloom that had
clouded his countenance for weeks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE VALLEY RANCHE.</p>


<p>Sybil Chase was sitting in the apartments which she had
taken on leaving Mr. Waring's residence.</p>

<p>Her dress, always simple and elegant, was even more
studied and elaborately delicate than usual; the face wore its
lightest, fairest look, and one seeing her as she sat gazing
down the street, evidently in momentary expectation of some
person not yet in sight, would have thought that no anxiety
or stern thought had ever found a resting-place in her
bosom.</p>

<p>That for which she had toiled and plotted, treading ruthlessly
over the hearts and happiness of all who stood in her
way, had been gained&mdash;in one week she would be the wife
of Edward Laurence.</p>

<p>Sybil was expecting him then; he spent the greater portion
of each day in her society, and the influence which she had
gained seemed constantly to increase.</p>

<p>While she waited there was a low knock at the door.
Sybil started up with a beautiful smile of welcome, which
changed to a look of surprise when the door opened and only
a servant appeared, saying:</p>

<p>"There's a gentleman, ma'am, who wants to see you."</p>

<p>"I am engaged. I told you to admit no one but Mr.
Laurence."</p>

<p>"I know it, but he would have me come up; he says he
won't keep you a moment."</p>

<p>"Be quick, then," she answered, impatiently.</p>

<p>The man went out and closed the door; but while Sybil
was considering who her visitor might be, it was flung open,
and Ralph Hinchley stood before her.</p>

<p>She stepped forward with an angry gesture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why have you come here?" she asked. "I do not
desire your visits, Mr. Hinchley."</p>

<p>"Nor is it at all probable that I shall ever pay you another,
madam; but this one you will have the patience to endure."</p>

<p>"Mr. Laurence will soon be here," she said, haughtily;
"possibly you would prefer not to meet him."</p>

<p>"I desire to see him&mdash;it is part of my business here; but
first, I wish to introduce an old acquaintance of yours."</p>

<p>He went to the door, flung it open, and Sybil beheld a
form which she had believed long since cold in the grave, the
old cruel light in the eyes, the mocking smile upon the lips&mdash;her
husband.</p>

<p>She started back with a cry of dreary pain.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Sybil," he said, quietly advancing
toward her. "Of course you are glad to see your 'own, own
Philip.' That used to be the term, I think."</p>

<p>"Keep off&mdash;keep off!" she shrieked, insane with fear and
the suddenness of the shock. "Philip Yates is dead. I saw
him hanged. You saw him, also, on the blasted pine, Ralph
Hinchley."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," returned Yates; "I ought to know, and I
assure you that I am as much alive as either of you. Tom
Dickinson, poor fellow, they hung him in my place. He
managed to steal my clothes from the wardrobe, hoping the
men would take him for me, and help him off. So you really
thought it was me they swung up; poor Sybil, what a disappointment!
Well, it was natural. Tom and I did look
alike, especially when he was on good behavior; but there
was a certain manner he never could catch. Still, the people
mistook him for me more than once. He was so proud of it,
poor Tom. But I wouldn't have thought it of you, Syb&mdash;not
know your own husband! My darling, that is not complimentary."</p>

<p>She answered by a groan so despairing that it might have
softened any heart less steeled against her than those of the
two men who looked quietly on.</p>

<p>"No, no, Sybil," he continued; "while Tom was doubling
like a fox, and you screaming for some one to pounce on me,
I slipped away through the cellar, and into the bush. Why,
bless your soul, I was perched just above you on the precipice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
all the time, and, if you hadn't made off with the horse, should
have got clear, instead of being caught among the rocks like
a rat in a trap."</p>

<p>Sybil sunk slowly into a chair while he was giving these
revolting details, and, covering her face with both hands,
interrupted him only with her faint moans. While she sat
thus abject and wounded, Edward Laurence entered the room.
He stopped short on the threshold, astonished at the presence
of those two men. He looked from one to the other in
amazement. Then turning on Hinchley, demanded in stern
wrath how he had dared to enter that dwelling. Sybil heard
his voice, and made a wild effort to shake off the terror which
was crushing her to the earth; but, as she attempted to
unvail her face, the smiling look with which Yates stood
regarding her made every nerve in her body shrink and
shiver.</p>

<p>Laurence glanced at her, and once more turned on Hinchley.</p>

<p>"Why are you here, sir, and who is that man?"</p>

<p>"Hush, hush!" returned Ralph, mournfully. "You will
have enough to repent, Edward; be silent now."</p>

<p>Before Laurence could speak, Yates stepped toward Sybil,
seized her by the arm, and forced her to stand up.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "you and I are going away from here."</p>

<p>"I will not move," she moaned, desperately. "Let me go,
I say."</p>

<p>Laurence started forward, trembling with indignation, but
the man pushed him rudely aside.</p>

<p>"Don't interfere between husband and wife," he said, coldly.
"I warn you it won't be safe. You know that, Syb, of old."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Laurence. "Great heavens,
Sybil, who is this man?"</p>

<p>She did not answer; in that moment all her duplicity and
art failed; she could only moan and turn away her frightened
face.</p>

<p>"I am Philip Yates, her husband," answered he. "I have
brought my marriage certificate on purpose to prove it."</p>

<p>He took a paper from his pocket and gave it to Laurence,
who read it with a confused idea of its import. At last he
lifted a hand to his forehead.</p>

<p>"I must be insane," he faltered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," returned Hinchley, "you are just coming back to
your senses. That woman, Laurence, is the female I saw in
California upon the night when I so narrowly escaped from
the Valley Ranche with my life."</p>

<p>"Never you mind that story," interrupted Yates; "that's
all gone by. Well, Mr. Laurence, you don't seem to believe
us yet; Sybil shall answer for herself."</p>

<p>"I will not speak," she cried. "You may kill me, but I
will not open my lips."</p>

<p>"Kill you, my pet? why, I expect years of happiness with
you still. We are going back to California, my dear. It will
take a long time to repay your loving kindness that night."</p>

<p>"Sybil! Sybil!" groaned Laurence.</p>

<p>"You shall speak," continued Yates. "Tell him your real
name; do it, I say!"</p>

<p>He transfixed her with his terrible glance; the old fear and
dread came back. She was like a person magnetized against
her will.</p>

<p>Without glancing toward Laurence, without being able to
move her eyes from that fiery glance, she answered in a low,
strange voice.</p>

<p>"I am Sybil Yates. I was his wife&mdash;I am his wife."</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed the gambler, exultingly. "Now, Mr.
Laurence, I hope you are satisfied."</p>

<p>The young man did not answer; he could only stand,
horror-stricken, upon the brink of the abyss down which he
had so nearly plunged.</p>

<p>Hinchley went to the door, and led in the woman who had
served for a time as housekeeper at Brooklawn.</p>

<p>"This person," he said, "has a story to tell; luckily,
circumstances have placed her quite in my power."</p>

<p>Sybil sprung again to her feet.</p>

<p>"Don't speak!" she cried; "don't speak!"</p>

<p>"I must, my dear," replied the woman, sobbing. "They'll
never let me alone if I don't."</p>

<p>"Who wrote the letter Mr. Laurence saw you give me?"
demanded Hinchley.</p>

<p>The woman pointed to Sybil.</p>

<p>"It is false!" she exclaimed. "Margaret Waring wrote it."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, Sybil," returned Yates. "What's the good of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
keeping this up? You're found out, and that's the end of it.
You thought I was dead, you wanted to marry Mr. Laurence&mdash;always
did, for that matter&mdash;and laid your plans beautifully.
Upon my word, I honor you! But, you see, I am
inconveniently alive; your old mother has been frightened
into telling the truth for once, so there's nothing for it but to
get away to the Valley Ranche. The miners have forgot
that little affair, and we shall find something brighter than
potatoes in the cellar. You know that."</p>

<p>She looked at him with her frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't take on so," he said, with a gleam of feeling. "I
always loved you better than you believed."</p>

<p>Sybil shuddered.</p>

<p>"So we'll forget and forgive. I don't mind it if you did
bring the vigilance committee down on us that night; Tom
and I were both hard on you&mdash;it wasn't work for a lady.
As for Mr. Hinchley, he ought to go down on his knees and
fill your lap with gold. If it hadn't been for her, I tell you,
old fellow, you never would have seen daylight again. After
all, that woman's a trump. I wouldn't give her up for all
the gold in California."</p>

<p>"Sybil," said Laurence, in a grave, low voice, "is this
thing true?"</p>

<p>She struggled for voice, and replied, very faintly:</p>

<p>"It is true! God help me, it is true; but I thought he was
dead. It was night, and I so terrified that the face was not
clear. Oh! if it were only death that he brings instead of
these bonds."</p>

<p>Laurence looked on her distress with heavy eyes.</p>

<p>"And Margaret."</p>

<p>She started as if a viper had stung her, then broke into
fresh moans, rocking to and fro on her chair.</p>

<p>"If we wronged her&mdash;if that letter was not genuine, tell
me, that I may offer the poor atonement in my power."</p>

<p>She looked up into his eyes with such anguish, that even
Yates seemed troubled.</p>

<p>"Speak the truth, Sybil," he said, "speak the truth, I say;
did the young lady write that letter they were talking about?"</p>

<p>Sybil shook her head, murmuring, under her breath, words
that no one could understand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak, Sybil."</p>

<p>"I wrote the letter."</p>

<p>"That's enough&mdash;that's like you, Sybil," said Yates, triumphantly,
forcing her cold hands from her face, and kissing
them till she shuddered all over. "Now you can go, gentlemen.
I should like a little private conversation with my wife."</p>

<p>Ralph Hinchley took Laurence by the arm, and led him
gently from the room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A year after this scene, when Yates had gone to California
in search of the gold left buried at the ranche, Laurence
and Margaret, all the wiser for the bitter experience of the
past, stood before the altar of the pretty church near Mr.
Waring's homestead, which was to be the resting-place of
their future lives. It had been a happy place to them once,
and now, with all the painful associations buried in perfect
confidence, they turned to it with renewed affection.</p>

<p>Surely, that little country church never witnessed a happier
wedding, or sheltered a lovelier bride. In the flush of
unchecked love, Margaret had bloomed into something more
attractive than mere beauty. The heavy sadness had left her
eyes, to be filled with gentle sunshine, her cheek was flushed
as with wild roses, and the soft radiance of a heart at rest fell
around her, pure as the silvery cloud of her bridal vail which
swept over the snow of her garments, clothing her with whiteness
from head to foot. The newly married pair went quietly
to the home which now became sacred to them both. The
ceremony which united their once estranged hearts had
endowed them with wealth, and thus it had been in their
power to keep that fine old place from the hammer. In after
years, the voices of merry children rung through the rose-thickets
where Sybil Yates had woven her snares, and a fine-looking
couple might have been observed, any fair day, walking
arm-in-arm along the walks which that artful woman had
once shared with the gentleman; but he had forgotten her in
the tranquil happiness of a peaceful life, and her name was
blotted out from all his thoughts, for he could not force such
company on the gentle image that filled his heart of hearts.
On the very day of this wedding, a wild scene was being
enacted at the Valley Ranche. Yates and Sybil had that day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
entered their old dwelling&mdash;he elated with the success of his
disguise, which had carried him through vigilance committees
and wild groups of gold-seekers, and she a weary, subdued
woman, who had outlived even the power of wishing, and
this while her hair was bright, and her cheeks smooth with
youth. She was aware that Edward Laurence was to be
married that day, but even that knowledge failed to disturb
the leaden apathy which lay upon her.</p>

<p>The ranche was desolate&mdash;an old Indian woman, who
remained in the kitchen, received them with more of terror
than welcome.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened, old woman," said Yates. "We
shan't stay long to trouble you; only get some supper for Mrs.
Yates, and find me some kind of a lamp. I don't like the
look of things here."</p>

<p>The old woman went to the other end of the kitchen, in
search of a lamp. In passing the window, she saw a crowd
of human faces looking in, but said nothing, as hands were
uplifted threateningly, and wild eyes glared a warning upon
her.</p>

<p>Yates went out, shading the lamp with his hands. He
took a large leathern sack from some luggage which had been
cast down in the hall, and went cautiously into the cellar.
Entering the inner cave, he removed the barrels, and, opening
the iron chest, gathered up handfuls of gold and packages of
dust, which he crowded roughly down into the bag. He was
busy with a larger package than had yet presented itself,
when a hand was laid heavily on his shoulder. Yates started
back, dragging the leather sack with him into the midst of a
crowd of armed men who filled the cellar. Some of these
men had been watching him all day, and now he was in their
power&mdash;utterly, hopelessly.</p>

<p>It was horrible, the stillness of that moment. Those fierce
men spoke in whispers. They dragged the victim forth in
silence, but the tramp of their feet fell horribly on the night.
Half an hour after Yates received that lamp from the trembling
hands of the Indian woman, exulting in his safety, a
branch of the blasted pine bent low with a second victim, and
Sybil was indeed a widow.</p>

<p>At this day, the Valley Ranche is inhabited by the solitary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
woman, who, with her Indian servant, lives alone in the old
house. She still sits by the chamber-window, and looks out
upon the bridle-path leading from the mines, but with the
dull apathy of a spirit which has lost every thing. Gray hairs
have crept thickly into those rich, golden tresses, and the
remnants of her beauty are mournful to look upon. One
thing is remarkable. She never receives a letter, and never
asks a question about any one in the Atlantic States. Sybil
Yates is indeed a widow now.</p>

<p>The wonderful career of <span class="smcap">Garibaldi</span> reads like a wild romance.
No man ever lived who has performed such prodigies of valor, or
who has had a more varied fortune. Mr. <span class="smcap">Victor</span> has had access to
the most authentic sources of information, and, it is but proper to
say, has produced THE ONLY AUTHENTIC LIFE of the man yet
given. It is written in a style calculated to enchain attention from
first to last, and will prove, unquestionably, one of the most interesting,
instructive and delightful books yet offered to the patrons of
the Dime Publications.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This biography of Garibaldi, the Hero of Italy, is a work of surpassing interest,
and, although perfectly authentic in all its details, equals in romantic
interest the 'Ivanhoe' of Sir Walter Scott. Those who desire to verify Lord
Byron's remark, that 'truth is stranger than fiction,' should not fail to read the
strangely eventful life of the foremost man of the nineteenth century. Get the
book, we say, and be convinced that the deeds of this extraordinary man were
never paralleled, even by the marvellous exploits of Richard C&oelig;ur de Leon and
those knights who followed Peter the Hermit in his Crusade for the recovery of
the Holy Sepulchre."</p>
